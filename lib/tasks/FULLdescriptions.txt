Finally, just as any collective should do, we strive for having some of the highest quality medicines available in the world. This selection of quality is based on the genotype and phenotypic expression of the flower, and also the quality of the actual growing environment and how it is applied to the production of our medicine. This last aspect is where our collective is set apart from many others in that we do not acquire medicine from outside vendors and only from rooted, established collective members who are at the core of our operations. We have complete control over how our strictly organic medicine is produced and what strains we choose to offer. This allows for an expansive ability to fit the specific needs of individuals suffering from various medical conditions. Many other collectives may claim they know where/how their medicine is produced when the truth is that it's a mystery. We have standards and sources that have consistently produced high quality organic medicine, and now we offer them discretely delivered directly to you. We operate in an atmosphere that ensures the security of the crop and safeguards against diversion for non-medical purposes. Our methods of operation and business form fall under the guidelines of the California State Attorney General. We are proud to be involved in a field that can provide health and wellness to individuals suffering from an array of conditions through a natural alternative to prescription medicines that often hold harmful and addictive properties. We want to be a productive, positive element in our community. We will do this through producing the highest quality organic medicine we can, and offering it to our patients at the lowest contribution amount possible. The driving principles behind what we are trying to do are compassion and good intent for everything around us. We feel that what we are doing is just, and true, and is reflected in the overwhelming support of the entire nation's general population. We hope that our species and our specific culture can continue to evolve in a direction of knowledge, understanding, strength, compassion, and respect.

We also want our patients to feel secure in the knowledge that they are not judged based on their illness, lifestyle, nor their choice of treatment. Each patient will be treated with the utmost respect, dignity, and discretion.</p>  <p>As medical marijuana patients, we have all had to endure the fear and stigma imposed upon us by nearly seventy years of marijuana prohibition. Despite the recent legalization of medical marijuana in Arizona and other states, the fear and stigma persist. All Greens is dedicated to healing the pain that stems from these destructive attitudes and feelings by providing a sensible alternative to the hysteria surrounding marijuana and by honoring our patients as a progressive and courageous force of change.</p>  <p>We believe one way we may do that is to be conscious and respectful in all our interactions with our neighbors.</p>  <p>All Greens believes each patient acts as an ambassador for the entire medical marijuana community. We want our fellow patients to feel cared for, to be recognized as important members of society, and to leave our facility inspired to be positive ambassadors for medical marijuana. Society is watching all of us to determine if medical cannabis is safe and sensible. If we dedicate ourselves to being such positive ambassadors for medical marijuana, our communities will begin to embrace us instead of being suspicious of us. The perception of medical marijuana will then be transformed, and the stigma associated with it will be eliminated.</p>  <p>All Greens sees this as the key for achieving safe and legal access to medical marijuana for all suffering and sick Americans. We invite you to join us in building a kinder and more compassionate world, and thank you for your efforts.</p>  <p></p> <p></p>

EXAMPLE: Let's say you want two different strains of a half ounce each, totaling a full ounce in quantity for your donation. Some collectives charge per half ounce a la carte ... but not APC!! We apply the &quot;bulk discount&quot; price to various combinations of patient donations. If the prices vary between desired strains, APC uses a formula suited to give YOU, the patient, the best and most importantly, fairest donation price! </p>  <p>Do you offer any veteran or senior discounts? <br />YES! Veterans receive 10% off up to $10!! Seniors can enjoy SENIOR SUNDAY! Anyone over the age of 62 qualifies for $5 off their entire order EVERY sunday! ** Please note, for all special discounts valid proof is required, thank you!*</p>  <p>Do I need a California I.D. to be a member with APC? <br />No, you do not need a California I.D., however, proof of residency IS required instead. This can be in the form of: A lease agreement, any DMV document, or utility bills. Student I.D.'s are not acceptable forms of residency. </p>  <p>Do I need a doctor's recommendation to order from APC? <br />Yes! PLEASE have ALL of your information handy before placing your call. This includes your current CALIFORNIA doctor's recommendation, as well as your driver's license and proof of residency if you are an out-of-state patient. Unfortunately, state law forbids us from accepting patients with out of state doctor's recommendations (Ex. Arizona). We can refer you to local San Diego doctors though!</p>  <p>What Should I Order? <br />APC's up to date offerings are online here on WeedMaps under the menu tab. Having a general idea of your order doesn't hurt when placing your call, although, our office staff is happy to help with any and all of your questions or concerns. We strive to offer you the best recommendation based on your medicinal needs. We take pride in our expertise on cannabis.</p>  <p>Do you have clones? <br />Yes, we typically have many clones at various life-cycle stages available for same-day delivery! Please note however, that the availability of certain strains depends on popularity at the given time and some strains may require a pre-order. Placing a call to APC never hurts though, so feel free to phone in with any questions about clones.</p>  <p>How far is your delivery radius? Why the charge? <br />APC has a 15 mile delivery radius. Any patient wishing to place an order outside of that 15 mile radius can still be serviced with the same great quality medicine, however the donation of a small 10 dollar delivery fee applies. This fee goes towards the driver's gas for the 30+ mile round trip to bring you the same great meds we offer to central san diego county. Again, we are a collective working TOGETHER.</p>  <p>By contacting APC, you the patient are acknowledging the following: <br />I am a California resident age 18 or older. I have a written recommendation for the use of medical cannabis from my doctor under Prop 215. I am not a law enforcement officer, nor a postal inspector, or operating under an assumed name or in cooperation with any criminal investigation; nor am I seeking out evidence which may serve as the basis for any charge of violating federal, state, or local laws. I will not use the medication provided for any non-medicinal purposes. Anyone who uses the provided medication for any purposes what so ever, will be assuming their own liability, and are responsible for their own actions. Any donations requested are only compensation for time, nutrients, electricity costs and other factors involved in the process of producing and delivering medical grade marijuana and not toward the sale or purchase of the medicine itself. This information is intended for doctor recommended patients in compliance w/Prop 215 and S.B. 420, California Health and Safety Code Section 11362.5 and 11362.7 et seq. and all local regulations. APC has the right to refuse service to anyone, and may request additional verification details prior to delivery. It is in your best interest to remember that APC is a working collective and together we must be tolerant and patient of each's others questions, concerns, and otherwise rights of individuality.</p> <p></p>

We strongly believe that for patients medicine should assist in the healing process and not hinder the bodies ability to recover. Therefore; we follow strict guidelines and requirements on all of our medications . The US government holds patents for the medicinal usage of cannabis because of its neuro-protectant and antioxidant properties.</p>  <p>Ancient holistic remedies is proud to help educate the masses about the nearly unlimited abilities of marijuana to help reduce stress, thwart depression and battle the effects of an astounding number of diseases and other adverse health conditions. The medical benefits of marijuana are far too numerous to present in one inclusive list. However,you'll find some of the most remarkable and clinically-proven medicinal benefits.</p>  <p>Cannabis sativa and indica has been used as a holistically effective medicinal agent on every continent, by all types of people, for thousands and thousands of years. As powerful international pharmaceutical companies continue to break down under the scrutiny and anger of world citizens, natural, holistic preventatives and cures, like marijuana, continue to resurface as sensible health solutions. There's no need to worry about a long list of possible side effects, many of which are more detrimental than the conditions being treated in the first place. And whether or not governmental agencies want to give in to widespread medicinal marijuana usage, in short time, they will have to. <br />We thank you for your attention and support towards the medical movement and our contribution back to The Wounded Warrior Project. We look forward to serving and meeting you. <br /> </p> <p></p>  <p></p> <p>Ancient Holistic Remedies is a cooperative organization helping patients find access to exceptional medication in a clean, safe, and confidential environment. <br />We proudly support and serve all of our armed forces hero's past and present.

The BCCCS promotes a holistic approach to healing and living. We see community an integral part of that healing. As Canada's oldest and largest compassion club, the BCCCS has been a model for other compassion clubs across the country that together serve an estimated 10,000 people. For more information about how we operate, see our Operational Standards for the Distribution of Medicinal Cannabis (PDF). As our credibility has increased over the years, the BCCCS has developed strong relationships within the larger community of health care organizations, educational institutions and local businesses. We also provide practicum placements for the University of Victoria nursing programme. We are a politically active organization - besides opening our doors, this entails giving presentations, writing reports and articles, and sending out press releases related to our mission, vision and values. </p> <p></p>

The ONLY collective in San Diego that tests ALL strains for potency and pathogens! Always consistent, best quality medicine available, lab tested and 100% safe for human consumption. Give us a try you won't go back to anything else. First time patient bonus: 1.0 grams medicine, your choice! Call 760-688-2867 </p> <p></p>  <p></p> <p> Our collective focuses on quality, consistency, and most importantly the safety of our patients. Many patients do not know of the major health concerns caused by improperly grown medical marijuana. Lab testing proves that most medical marijuana on the market today still has pesticides and fertilizers present and can be toxic to human health. Our medical marijuana is grown indoor with methods unconventional to most growers today. All air coming into our indoor gardens is UV treated to prevent mold and pathogens We use a full spectrum of light that is not provided by high pressure sodium or metal halide bulbs. Our focus is not on the power of our lights (watts, lumens). Instead we ensure that all our plants are provided with a full spectrum of light that parallels our sun. To create the safest medicine available our growers only add water to the plants life cycle for the last four weeks. No pesticides are ever used while our plants have started their blooming or flowering stage. Lab tests prove that all harmful pesticides and chemicals have been removed from our final product. When medical marijuana is grown properly under the right conditions it is a wonderful, clean, safe, all-natural medicine. The best medical marijuana strains available today are low-yielding strains. Within the industry we find growers are quick to talk about how much yield or product that they can produce off each plant. It's simple for many growers to focus on the money the plant can provide rather then the best possible medicine. We don't focus on yield. Our growers are dedicated to quality and perfecting the genetics of their plants. When you focus on these aspects you create only the best plants and medicine possible. We let the results of our hard work and dedication speak for themselves. </p>  <p>We are in full compliance with California state law and guidelines. You must have valid California drivers license or I.D. card, and current doctor's recommendation or valid California MMIC card. Verification is quick and easy over the phone.

Smokes heavy and it creeps takes ahwile to get going but in the end very clear and energetic high. <strong>RP Headband: </strong>The high is not too overpowering, and lasts a long time, making it good utility daytime smoke. Headband is good for reducing anxiety. <strong> </strong> <strong>OG 18: </strong>The high feels like a bubble has been stretched around you. When the bubble pops, it is as if the high caused time to warp.OG #18 optimal for focused leisure such as playing video games, but a terrible idea for driving or staying on schedule. <strong>Vanilla OG Kush: </strong>Vanilla Kush brings out creamy vanilla flavors in this pure indica Kush. This strain induces a strong sense of relaxation, easing muscle tension, which appeals to many medical marijuana users. In smaller amounts, the mental effect is euphoric and thoughtful, yet relaxed. Heavy indulgence strengthens the effects, leading to a trippy and potentially sleepy tunnel vision that may cause couchlock or napping. <strong>Lemon Ice: </strong>Lemon Ice marijuana is a plant for the new age. Developed to be stronger and tastier than any other plant. The result is a very good smoke with exceptional high. Large, sticky buds look and smell amazing. You've got to try this bud, one of the finest marijuana strains in the world. <strong>Grape Kush #2 </strong>Growing plants have a strong odor, both sweet and musky.The harvest from this strain is connoisseur-grad ebud with a sweetish smoke. The high comes on very slowly, building up for as much as an hour, and then settles in for the night - a bit more like a pot brownie stone than the usual smoker's rush. traces of haze in the stone add inspiration to the conversation, and some radiant dreams or fantasies at bedtime. It's a relaxing and social effect, like red wine, and a good antidote to social anxiety. <strong> </strong> <strong></strong> <strong> </strong> <strong><em> </em></strong></p> <p></p>

30868:::Chronic Therapy:::<p></p> <p>In the beginning, there was no name, no storefront and no growers. Four friends began a conversation on where to get medical marijuana for a family member suffering from cancer. That was the beginning.

Using our savings, selling luxury items, maxing out credit cards and tightening our boot straps we made our dreams a reality, Chronic Therapy was born. Chronic Therapy was created in 2010 and has grown to a small, family run business where our number one goal is to help people with pain management and provide top quality MMJ at affordable prices.

9014:::Compassionate Pain Management:::<p></p> <p>A Message From the Owner: <br />I founded CPM in August, 2009, when I saw the potential for cannabis to help people, and to do this in a professional, compassionate way. I wanted to create a Medical Marijuana Center experience like none other, and to deliver top-quality cannabis and customer service in a setting much like a medical doctor's office</p>  <p>The Patient Experience: <br />Visiting a Medical Marijuana Center can be a patient's most important appointment of the week. When you depend on something for your health, you can find great value in compassionate and understanding care from professionals.</p>  <p>I'm proud to say that CPM offers all patients one-on-one private consultations with caregivers. We promote legitimate medical treatment through cannabis and our goal is to create a professional atmosphere that allows patients to feel comfortable with their experience.</p>  <p>Our Passion for People: <br />I can feel the energy of our people in this company. Everybody in CPM — caregivers, receptionists, growers and trimmers — they do all of their jobs with their hearts and souls. They believe in our mission. Patients are loyal to us because they value their experience with us. When we are able to pass along savings to patients, we always do. Satisfaction is guaranteed.</p>  <p>Our Passion for Plants: <br />Our team of nine growers cultivates more than 70 strains of medical cannabis, which we only sell in jars. Why is quality packaging important? These opaque, airtight jars keep buds fresh and continue the curing process.</p>  <p>Continuing Care: <br />We look out for patients. We make sure that they know when to renew their Medical Marijuana Cards (red cards) and keep them informed on industry happenings. We often call patients to let them know that their favorite strains are in stock.</p>  <p>Giving Back: <br />We depend on the community, which is why we give back to the community. Here are some local causes that we like to support: American Heart Association, National MS Society Colorado, Chabad of Boulder/Longmont, Firefighters Association, Police Brotherhood Association and more... </p> <p></p>

Most of our Flowers haven't seen light or air since they were trimmed, other than the exactly 62% RH air in their stainless steel vaults. No more donating for &quot;hay&quot; smelling cannabis that has been destroyed by baking under bright retail lights all day, everyday! </p>  <p>Any imports we obtain from outside the greater Spokane area will be labeled with the city the medicine was produced in. This system allows the patient to make more informed decisions on what type of medication best suits their standards and/or budget. </p>  <p>The imported products are generally higher donations. This is due to the of the logistics of driving to pick them up, and also because markets outside of Spokane generally have higher priced donations on wholesale medicine. The requested donations on our page for imports are the M.S.R.D. (Manufacturer's suggested retail donation) and also the average for what co-ops on the west side of the state charge. We appreciate your understanding and we will strive to offer an affordable assortment of local products with comparable quality to the imports! </p>  <p>We are always looking for new vendors, growers, and collective gardens to work with.

The leaves of the cannabis plant also contain some cannabinoids, but in much lower concentration. The flowers and leaves of the plant can be smoked, vaporized, or used to prepare edibles. <strong>Cannabis Sativa</strong> Cannabis Sativa is a tall, slower growing and maturing plant that typically has long thin leaves that may vary in color from light green to darker green. Sativa buds are long and thin and turn red as they mature in a warm environment. In cooler environments the buds may be slightly purple. Sativa plants smell sweet and fruity and the smoke is generally quite mild. Cannabis sativa is a source of fiber for rope and other products. The cannabis sativa medicating effect is often characterized as uplifting and energetic. The effects of a cannabis sativa are mostly cerebral. They give a feeling of optimism and wellbeing, as well as providing a good measure of pain relief for certain symptoms. A few pure sativas are also very high in THC content. They are known to have a quite hallucinogenic effect. Sativas are a good choice for daytime medication. <strong>Cannabis Indica</strong> Cannabis indica is a short to moderate height bushy plant, generally between three and six feet, and its leaves have short broad fingers. The leaves are generally dark green, and are sometimes tinged with purple. As they near maturity, the leaves may turn more purple in color. Indica is a strong smelling plant. The smoke of indicas is generally thick and more prone to cause coughing when inhaled. Indicas are the traditional source of hashish. The cannabis indica medicating effect is most often described as a pleasant body buzz. Indicas are great for relaxation, stress relief, and for an overall sense of calm and serenity. Cannabis indicas are also very effective for overall body pain relief, and often used in the treatment of insomnia. They are the late evening choice of many patients as an all-night sleep aid. <strong>Hash</strong> Hash or hashish is manufactured by separating the trichomes from the cannabis flowers, to create a concentrated dose of this specific part of the cannabis plant. The trichomes are the glistening whitish specks that you see on dried cannabis flowers. The trichomes are then processed into a relatively solid paste or block. Hash can be somewhat powdery or more solid and sticky, depending on exactly how it was processed. Because of its elevated concentration, a much smaller quantity is necessary to receive the same effects as with the dry flowers. Hash can be smoked or vaporized by itself, generally a special attachment or device is necessary to use has with your vaporizing equipment. Check with your vaporizer manufacturer for more information. Has can also be used to make edibles It can also be sprinkled on top of cannabis before smoking or vaporizing to augment the trichome content in the flowers. </em></strong></p> <p></p>  <p></p> <p> <strong><em>Tourist Welcome</em></strong> <strong>The Depot Town Dispensary is dedicated to providing qualified patients access to scientifically tested medical-grade cannabis in a safe, convenient, and affordable manner, in an environment where all are treated with respect, compassion, and care.

Marijuana comes in two basic types - sativa and indica. Which type you choose will determine the effects you feel. Each type has its own distinct set of characteristics. Sativas are known for their height and their leggy, often sparse, leaves. Sativas can be anywhere from tall and round like a massive bush, to lean and spindly with a few large colas. The leaves - a trademark of the sativa strain - are long and thin. The odor varies with the particular strain that is growing. The sativa high is often characterized as uplifting and energetic. The effects of a sativa marijuana are mostly cerebral. They give a feeling of optimism and well - being, as well as providing a good measure of pain relief for certain symptoms. A few pure sativas are also very high in THC content. They are known to have a quite spacey, or hallucinogenic, effect. Sativas are a good choice for daytime smoking. Indicas are known for their smaller stature. They are relatively short and bushy. Some are compact, others are of a more moderate height. Indicas tend to grow wider and rounder than sativas. Many look like small shrubs. Indicas typically grow out many more smaller side colas. The indica highs are most often described as a pleasant body buzz. Indicas are great for relaxation, stress relief, and for an overall sense of calm and serenity. Marijuana indicas are also very effective for overall body pain relief, and often used in the treatment of insomnia. They are the late - evening choice of many smokers as an all - night sleep aid. A few pure indica strains are very potent in THC, and will cause the &quot;couchlock&quot; effect, enabling the smoker to simply sit still and enjoy the experience of the smoke. Marijuana strains are available in the entire spectrum from pure sativas to pure indicas, and in every combination in - between. There are 30% sativa - 70% indica strains, there are 80% sativa - 20% indica strains, and many, many 50% - 50% combinations, as well as others. </strong> NOTE: Elixir is in full compliance with California Prop. 215 (The Compassionate Use Act of 1996), SB420 and California Health &amp; Safety Code Sections 1136.5, 11362.77 and 11362.775. </p> <p></p>

FULLYS STORY Read how it all began and listen to my hearts plea. I have waded through the cloudy waters of this healing herb for as long as I have been an adult. After having my entire crop stolen from me, I was forced to rely on a delivery service to fulfill my alternative medicinal choice. Although, I was admittedly happy that I no longer had to go to an illegitimate source (where I was paying 90 bones for the bomb-diggity!) I was not happy with the size or quality. I want everyone that has taken the bold move of controlling what they put in their body as medicine to be saved the 3 years of wasting money, energy, and emotional distress. Finally find relief as well as clarity about this seed bearing fruit. I also want everyone that has been locked down by the pills that were promised to lift them up to take a second look at our organic healing herb. I will work with the farmers to up quality and production to fill the gaps in the need -vs.- supply. I will only take what is necessary to operate this and give the rest back to you in lower donations. I will not give up on quality to increase productivity or profitability. OUR PLEDGE We Promise to never sacrifice quality for quantity. We will always give you the best bang for your buck! *YOUR PAIN STOPS HERE: 360-953-0771* All patients must provide their valid Washington State Medical Marijuana Authorization on it's original tamper proof paper and also a valid government issued photo identification.

No ID found.  This store may not have menu items listed.:::Green Cross Society of B.C.:::<p></p> <p> We Can Help The Green Cross Society of British Columbia is a member's driven, non-profit organization. All members are disabled, the majority managing chronic pain, addictions, HIV and diseases dealing with anti-viral and other medication side effects. </p> <p></p>  <p></p> <p> Mr. Paul Hunt and Ms. Arla Kaye founding directors along with other members of the B.C. Compassion Club Society opened the Green Cross Society of B.C in 2005. This was done in response to the growing number of members and the need for quality control and scientific research. As a registered non-profit society we are a member's driven group, with the goal of providing our people with the highest quality herbal medicines available, plus education and participation in healing their own illness. A high percentage of our membership is on disability and has not responded to conventional therapies. We offer natural herbal remedies that are non-toxic and, for the most part, do not cross react with pharmaceutical drugs. As a result of this property we are able to offer harm reduction life styles. Our approach is to move people away from addiction, not only to street drugs, but to prescription drugs and alcohol. We help people who suffer from chronic pain. Often a result of a job related, or automobile injury their pain is most frequently treated with addictive and ultimately harmful (to liver and kidney) opiates. We address this pain with natural product, quality controlled, cannabis such that members are able to make significant cuts or complete elimination of these drugs. We help people with HIV/AIDS. A recent large scale study in the U.K. showed that more than one quarter of people with AIDS use cannabis to treat their symptoms. We have responded to this need by forming an alliance with the local British Columbia People with AIDS (PWA) Society. We are attempting to meet their needs for clean medicine by running routine quality control checks on product provided. In addition, we are initiating research protocols intended to optimize symptom relief with cannabis regimes and anti-vital medicines. We help people with MS, Chronic pain, Epilepsy, Chron's disease. The immune modulating, anti-inflammatory, analgesic properties of cannabis make it an excellent candidate for treating these ailments. Many of our members are taking part in research studies into responses of their own illness to various herbal treatments. We help people with addictions. A number of our members are now free of cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin addiction using natural herbal and supplemental medicines. In addition, we offer a non-judgmental, relaxed entry into a better lifestyle, by sharing experience, strength and hope with the addict. Our mission is to offer safe, quality controlled, standardized herbal medicines to our growing membership, plus provide guidance, friendship and support on their road to a better quality of life. </p> <p></p>

23686:::Green Heart Club:::<p></p> <p>Ask about Senior/Vet/Educator discount!</p> <p></p>  <p></p> <p> At Green Heart Club, our focus is bringing the highest quality of medical marijuana to the Davis market. As MM patients in the Davis area, we recognized the challenge of finding quality medicine in the available markets. The closest dispensaries are in Sacramento but we found that the best bud was going straight to the higher-paying markets in SF and LA, making it difficult to find high quality, potent medicine in the available dispensaries. We started GHC, a collective of local growers and patients which delivers directly to the Davis market as well as surrounding areas without the ability to easily access a brick and mortar dispensary. We bring a range of high quality indoor flowers, selected for their medicinal potency, and continue to develop medicinal products to meet the needs of our patients.</p>  <p> We are very proud to feature our flagship medicine 'Blue Star Chronic'. This medicine is grown utilizing the newest in indoor growing technology - led and plasma lighting. With these unique light spectra, Blue Star is able to bring out some of the most exotic tastes and strongest effects around. Guaranteed. The future of indoor is already here, and you can only get it here exclusively at Green Heart Club. </p> <p></p>

Ask us about the qualifications of our delivery driver. </p> <p></p>  <p></p> <p> <strong>About Green Ridge Green Ridge Organic Farms</strong></p>  <p> <strong>Green Ridge Organics</strong> is a delivery service in Solano County. We were previously a group of friends who grew for each other and we were members of a small private collective. </p>  <p> Most delivery services and dispensaries purchase their medicine from &quot;vendors&quot;. Be cautious about this. Our growers are our original founding members. They are craftsmen (and craftswomen). All our grows are small, boutique, operations - so our growers have time to attend to each plant and take extra care in preparing medication. </p>  <p> If you have a real medical condition, we are your collective. If you appreciate straightforward talk, you'll like us. And if you are fussy about the quality of your medication, we are right there with you. We really listen to our members and we help them tailor solutions that optimize their health and happiness. We are careful about how we grow our medicine and what we offer to you, because we use it ourselves. </p>  <p> Our top-shelf is pure top-bud (not the popcorn buds from the bottom of the plant), and we allow our plants to mature completely. We find this allows better pain relief, energy and clarity of thought, without anxiety - even with strains that are famous for causing anxiety. Commercial &quot;vendors&quot; tend to harvest early, because every day is more cost and risk. We think this compromises the medical value.</p>  <p> Our corporate secretary and our CEO both operated USDA and FDA inspected food plants so they are fastidious about the cleanliness of our grows. This is important, since some of our members and friends have compromised immune systems. </p>  <p> Give us a shout. We will treat you right. <br /> <br /> This page is Intended for California residents, 21 years of age or older, with a valid California ID and a valid doctor's recommendation for Medical Marijuana. <br /> </p> <p></p>

SIMULTANEOUSLY. At Higher Approach we hold ourselves to a much higher standard of care than is typically found in the industry. Too often patients are forced to accept questionable product, inefficient practices, unprofessional employees, and a lackadaisical attitude towards timeliness with a grain of salt. We created Higher Approach to give patients an alternative to the madness. No longer will you have to blindly order your medicine based on its name or employee recommendation, because we have provided a detailed and up-to-date menu online @ www.higherapproach.com with pictures, descriptions, and lab test results for all of our medicine. **If you're still unsure, or don't want to go to our website, we have a sample of every strand in glass jar for you to look at, smell, feel, smoosh between your fingers, or however you like to examine your medicine.** For your convenience we have an OPTIONAL delivery booking system, so that our busyness won't affect your wait time. It requires less than a day's planning, and ensures that you always know when we're coming. Again, if you didn't book a delivery, no worries... we are always accepting call-ins and new patients. Our early morning and evening hours were chosen to cater to the busy professional, and it is our goal to provide the privacy, consistency, speed, and professionalism that their lifestyle demands. You will have the freedom to access us for verification or ordering 24-7 online, on your own schedule, not just during set business hours. In keeping with our high quality philosophy, Higher Approach has chosen to carry only top shelf medicine (flowers and concentrates) and edibles. <br />Higher Approach welcomes your plastic, whether it be VISA, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover.</p> <p></p>

We are mature, professional, knowledgeable, prompt and courteous. Our reviews vouch for our compassion and customer service. If you are looking for a dependable, trustworthy conduit for medical cannabis, then please give us a call and experience the professional touch the medical marijuana industry so badly needs.

Of course, you may find other gifts, like papers, hemp wick, lighters or grams inside your jar! This is a very high quality jar that will last for years but still it is just schwag. Medical Marijuana, on the other hand, is really why you are here. It is a passport to relief, rest and rejuvenation. Its a hiatus from the mental fatigue of chronic pain and illness.

Supercritcal extraction involves pressurizing and heating dry material along with liquid or gaseous CO2. The combination of heat and temperature turns the harmless carbon dioxide into a solvent, which extracts the active ingredients out of cannabis. The same process is used to extract caffeine from coffee (thats how we get decaf now!) and to extract flavoring, like vanilla extracts. When used with cannabis, the resulting oil is a safe, pure, potent, pest- and mold-resistant, easy-to-dose, and highly effective medicine with many applications. It is comparable to butane waxes in potency, but WITHOUT any risk of exposure to harmful butane or ethanol residue used to make many other waxes and oils.</p> <p></p>

Not HQD! Other delivery places that did seem decently priced would always have a minimum delivery charge, (usually like 80-100 dollars, which I cannot afford!) Not HQD! Some delivery places seemed decently priced, with no minimum delivery charge, BUT you literally have to wait until THE NEXT DAMN DAY for your order to go through and be delivered to your house (what's the point, you guys, seriously?) Not HQD! (The first time I had contacted them and started the verification process, they responded back with ETA 5 seconds...I was like are you kidding me? They are literally that fast, a huge plus!) Deaf Friendly Meter (out of 5) 6/5!! The fact that you can conduct business discreetly over text messaging is great for us deafies. Both guys are very easy to lipread and understand, and not to mention, super-friendly! Bud Quality is phenomenal. My FTP they hooked me up with some top-shelf I was not at all dissapointed! Been a while since I had a real strong OG flavor and taste in a bud lately. Real big and well trimmed nugs, tight and just a pleasure to smoke. Now enjoying my Saturday morning with some of their amazing Kobe OG they dropped off yesterday. I love their price ranges too, I have yet to try any edible or concentrate, but I know it'll be some danky fire for sure. :} Last but not least, the very fact that you do not have to: Hop into your car, deal with moronic LA traffic and drivers for around half an hour, fight to find parking (most dispensaries lately don't seem to have their own lots anymore...so sad that a bunch of good ones have shut down in Eagle Rock area w/ no explanation), walk through sometimes sketchy neighborhoods, fill out 10 page applications, and deal with people behind thick glass, etc...you get the idea...makes delivery all the much better! And High Quality Delivery delivers in spades! They are the top of the crop, you can't go wrong with these guys. And now it says they're open 24 hours? Good lord. A+++&quot; - Deafstoner <br /> <br />The FOrce is Finally With Us! - December 03, 2012 </p>  <p>&quot;Thanks HQD, The FTP deal was a great one.....Also The Yoda is Very Helpful in taking care of the pain, and is the right amount of potency (THC)! Thanks for calling me and keeping me informed when you would be arriving. The coolest Staff Period. Im not calling anyone else period! The fact that I see you guys adjusting the price to make it affordable is also excellent!&quot; - EarthManFourTwenty <br /> <br />THE BEST IN TOWN, EVEN THE CITY! </p>  <p>The FTP deal was a great one.....Also The Yoda is Very Helpful in taking care of the pain, and is the right amount of potency (THC)!

With low prices, high grade medication, and free delivery 2 EVERYONE , Hollistic Essentials offers an easy way to get the medication you need. </p> <p></p>  <p></p> <p> About Hollistic Essentials is a marijuana dispensary and delivery service. Modern research suggests that cannabis is a valuable aid in the treatment of a wide range of clinical applications. These include pain relief particularly of neuropathic pain (pain from nerve damage), nausea, spasticity, glaucoma, and movement disorders. Marijuana is also a powerful appetite stimulant, specifically for patients suffering from HIV, the AIDS wasting syndrome, or dementia. Emerging research suggests that marijuana's medicinal properties may protect the body against some types of malignant tumors and are neuroprotective. With all these benefits, and no medical problems (if used with a vaporizer or taken in edible form), who wouldn't want to use a drug as safe and effective as Marijuana for pain or other illnesses? For Holistic Essentials, providing great medical marijuana (edibles and raw plant) isn't enough. We go two steps further, we offer top of the line service, and also deliver our products, all for free. At Hollistic Essentials, everything is about the customer, we are a non-profit organization dedicated to helping you. We even offer a 5% <strong>discount</strong> for our veteran, senior citizen, and homebound patients. Just be sure to mention this when you call! </p> <p></p>

All New Patients get a free gift bag and free gram of Og Kush. What is the difference between Indica and Sativa - Indica and Sativa are both cannabis strains. Indicas are notably squatter with more crystals while Sativa is more elongated with its crystals kept in the core. Indicas are much more heavier than sativas. The high is more of a body stoned effect great for stress and pain, versus a more cerebral high from sativa. Many feel that Indica is going to make them sleepier, while Sativa gets you UP. The Sativa High : The sativa high is often characterized as uplifting and energetic . The effects of a sativa marijuana are mostly cerebral. They give a feeling of optimism and well - being, as well as providing a good measure of pain relief for certain symptoms. A few pure sativas are also very high in THC content. They are known to have a quite spacey, or hallucinogenic, effect. Sativas are a good choice for daytime smoking. The Indica High : The indica highs are most often described as a pleasant body buzz. Indicas are great for relaxation, stress relief, and for an overall sense of calm and serenity. Marijuana indicas are also very effective for overall body pain relief, and often used in the treatment of insomnia. They are the late - evening choice of many smokers as an all - night sleep aid. A few pure indica strains are very potent in THC, and will cause the &quot;couchlock&quot; effect, enabling the smoker to simply sit still and enjoy the experience of the smoke.</p> <p></p>  <p></p> <p>Welcome to Hollywood High Grade! We are a City of Los Angeles licensed Pre-ICO collective. We are a members-only and member-run group of qualified medical patients that have come together to cultivate marijuana for medical use. </p> <p></p>

As grower &amp; owner of Maggie's Farm, I feel fortunate for the opportunity to FINALLY share the results of a product grown under my native state's SUN and climate with the Medical Marijuana community. This is a different level of medicine of which you can FEEL. THANKS TO ALL PATIENTS WHO HAVE DARED TRY A DIFFERENT OUTDOOR PRODUCT, AND FOR SPREADING THE WORD AMONG THE COMMUNITY!

(1/3 non-refundable deposit required.) ______________________________________ <strong>NEW STRAINS</strong> Mary Jane's Medicine Shop is experimenting with new growers so we bring in 2-4 new strains every week. Each grower has given us a VERY limited supply for our members to sample. When we find a great strain/grower we do our best to make that a regular on our menu. <strong>ALL OF THESE STRAINS ARE FIRE!</strong> So, if you are lucky enough to try one of these experimental strains, we are asking you to give us a review so we can better know the quality of each grower/strain. <strong>OUR GOAL:</strong> To bring you ONLY the very best grown medicine, grown by the VERY best growers at the very best prices and as quickly as possible. <strong>REVIEW: </strong>I have smoked a few of these strains so far because I wanted to have a better idea of how each of them worked. ALL I can say is WOW... I love my job! I woke up this morning and smoked some 3 KINGS and boy did it slow me down. Next up I smoked Peacemaker and if you pick this one up be sure you have some where comfortable to kick it for a while. I could literally feel the high tugging me down from the back of my head and strait onto my butt. I also smoked some Alaskan Thunderfuck last night and if you like an upper that one has a very uplifting effect, which I found to be very enjoyable. ALSO I thought it smoked like Christmas... If that makes any scene. <strong>UPDATE:</strong> Mary Jane is currently rejecting 8 out of every 10 strains presented to us by our growers. Of these 20% of strains that have made our cut, you the members, have so far only rejected one offering. Although we wish we could get it right every time we are proud of the strains we carry and know the quality will speak for itself. ______________________________________ <strong>QUALITY &amp; ACCURACY GUARANTEED </strong> <strong>Quality Guaranteed: </strong>Mary Jane stands behind the flowers she has on her menu 100%. If the medication you receive does not meet your needs you MUST contact us within 24 hours so we can exchange out your remaining medication for something more suitable. It's that easy...

(1/3 non-refundable deposit required.) ______________________________________ <strong>NEW STRAINS</strong> Mary Jane's Medicine Shop is experimenting with new growers so we bring in 2-4 new strains every week. Each grower has given us a VERY limited supply for our members to sample. When we find a great strain/grower we do our best to make that a regular on our menu. <strong>ALL OF THESE STRAINS ARE FIRE!</strong> So, if you are lucky enough to try one of these experimental strains, we are asking you to give us a review so we can better know the quality of each grower/strain. <strong>OUR GOAL:</strong> To bring you ONLY the very best grown medicine, grown by the VERY best growers at the very best prices and as quickly as possible. <strong>REVIEW: </strong>I have smoked a few of these strains so far because I wanted to have a better idea of how each of them worked. ALL I can say is WOW... I love my job! I woke up this morning and smoked some 3 KINGS and boy did it slow me down. Next up I smoked Peacemaker and if you pick this one up be sure you have some where comfortable to kick it for a while. I could literally feel the high tugging me down from the back of my head and strait onto my butt. I also smoked some Alaskan Thunderfuck last night and if you like an upper that one has a very uplifting effect, which I found to be very enjoyable. ALSO I thought it smoked like Christmas... If that makes any scene. <strong>UPDATE:</strong> Mary Jane is currently rejecting 8 out of every 10 strains presented to us by our growers. Of these 20% of strains that have made our cut, you the members, have so far only rejected one offering. Although we wish we could get it right every time we are proud of the strains we carry and know the quality will speak for itself. ______________________________________ <strong>QUALITY &amp; ACCURACY GUARANTEED </strong> <strong>Quality Guaranteed: </strong>Mary Jane stands behind the flowers she has on her menu 100%. If the medication you receive does not meet your needs you MUST contact us within 24 hours so we can exchange out your remaining medication for something more suitable. It's that easy... We know sometimes the medication is to STRONG or to WEAK for your needs and it's our job to make sure you get what you NEED. <strong>Accuracy Guaranteed:</strong> Mary Jane stands behind the accuracy of all flowers and concentrates which have been weighed to your door with our <strong>DOUBLE THE DIFFERENCE GUARANTEE</strong>.

14673:::NHCD / East Bay:::<p></p> <p>Natural Healing Connection Delivery is a Non-Profit, 100% compliant delivery only service. Our mission, is to try to provide a delivery service that is known for being compassionate and fair, without losing the quality. As many of us struggle to just make ends meet, there is already enough stress and anxiety without having to worry about how you are going to be able to get your medicine. We understand that there are many services to choose from, most of them provide a great service. We just want to be part of those that truly care about you and are providing this very essential and necessary service for all the right reasons. By now, you probably have read our menu and noticed our donation amounts. We already know what you are thinking, &quot;this medicine must not be very good&quot;, well, as we like to say, &quot;Don't judge a Bud by its number&quot;! That's it, that's all we got. We're not going to try and convince you that we're the &quot;best&quot;, or provide the &quot;best&quot; medicine. In all honesty, we're not so sure that anyone can say for sure which is the &quot;best&quot;, there's just too many to try. What we will do, is guarantee you that we will ALWAYS try to provide the highest quality medicine we can, for a reasonable and fair donation. We will listen to you, give you the best information we can and most of all, really and truly care. We guarantee these things, only because they are things that we at NHCD can control. We will never promise or guarantee anything that we cannot completely control, such as, traffic, road work, etc. There are times that we get quite busy and the delivery time may be up to 2-3 hours from the time you order. We make it a habit to keep in contact so that you know how much longer it will be, and we will NEVER not show up. To be able to provide you with a higher quality medicine for a fair donation, this is one of those things where we all have to try and work together and really just be understanding. If you are in immediate need, place your order early to be sure you receive it when you would like. You may also request a specific time you would like your delivery, if that specific time is open and our driver is not already across town, we would be happy to deliver at the specified time. <strong><strong>All patients must be Pre-Verified by providing the following:</strong> <strong>California Drivers License</strong> <strong>Original Recommendation with stamp and doctor signature</strong> <strong>Patients must also provide these at time of visit</strong> <strong>NO EXCEPTIONS!!</strong> <strong>By contacting us, you agree and acknowledge the following:</strong> <strong>You are over 18 years of age.</strong> <strong>You have a *current* Medical Marijuana recommendation from a licensed physician in the state of California.</strong> <strong>You are not a law enforcement officer, nor a postal inspector, or operating under an assumed name or in cooperation with any criminal investigation, nor are you seeking out evidence which may serve as a basis for any charge of violating, federal, state, or local laws.</strong> <strong>You have read and understand Proposition 215, SB420 and the laws pertaining to your rights and limitations as a medical marijuana patient.</strong> <strong><em></em></strong><strong><em>This is a legal advertisement for Medicinal Marijuana in compliance with California H&amp;S 11362.5, Prop 215 &amp; CA SB 420.

Nurturing In Cannabis Extracts - N.I.C.E. wellness. Delivery requires minimum $40.00 donation. </p> <p></p>  <p></p> <p>At N.I.C.E. Wellness, Inc. our goal is to provide safe access/delivery to our patient(s)/member(s). We understand the importance in mother natures alternative medicine and its ability to help a wide range of ailments, an with research that list continues to grow. We have witnessed, first-hand from MMJ patients that suffer from cancer, damaged vertebra, head (brain) injuries, depression, insomnia, the list goes on and on….how medicinal cannabis has improved the persons overall well being an quality of life. Knowing many others suffer from such ailments and are in search of alternative treatment(s), medicine(s) and remedies, N.I.C.E. Wellness, Inc. collective was formed. </p>  <p>Some Research Information: <br />Modern research suggests that cannabis is a valuable aid in the treatment of a wide range of clinical applications. These include pain relief -- particularly of neuropathic pain (pain from nerve damage) -- nausea, spasticity, glaucoma, and movement disorders. Marijuana is also a powerful appetite stimulant, specifically for patients suffering from HIV, the AIDS wasting syndrome, or dementia. Emerging research suggests that marijuana's medicinal properties may protect the body against some types of malignant tumors and are neuro-protective.</p>  <p>Cannabinoids have a remarkable safety record, particularly when compared to other therapeutically active substances. Most significantly, the consumption of marijuana -- regardless of quantity or potency -- cannot induce a fatal overdose. According to a 1995 review prepared for the World Health Organization, &quot;There are no recorded cases of overdose fatalities attributed to cannabis, and the estimated lethal dose for humans extrapolated from animal studies is so high that it cannot be achieved by ... users.&quot; As with any medication, patients should consult thoroughly with their physician before deciding whether the medical use of cannabis is safe and appropriate</p>  <p>N.I.C.E. Wellness, Inc. was formed adhering to California Proposition 215, the California Compassionate Use Act, which was enacted by the voters and took effect on Nov. 6, 1996 as California Health &amp; Safety Code 11362.5. The law makes it legal for patients and their designated primary caregivers to possess and cultivate marijuana for their personal medical use given the recommendation or approval of a California-licensed physician. </p>  <p>And</p>  <p>SB 420, a legislative statute, went into effect on January 1, 2004 as California H&amp;SC 11362.7-.83. This law broadens Prop. 215 to transportation and other offenses in certain circumstances; allows patients to form medical cultivation “collectives” or “cooperatives”; and establishes a voluntary state ID card system run through county health departments. SB 420 also establishes guidelines or limits as to how much patients can possess and cultivate. Legal patients who stay within the guidelines are supposed to be protected from arrest. </p>  <p>We Thank You an Have a NICE Day,</p>  <p>N.I.C.E.

Natural Alternatives only works with LOCAL (SW Washington) growers who take the time and money to cultivate quality medicine, concentrates, topicals and edibles for our patients and collective members in Clark County. Natural Alternatives' growers have cumulatively more than 100 years of experience producing the highest level medicine.

Therefore, you must be at least 18 years old and have a current Medical Marijuana tamper proof recommendation and a valid state license or ID.

Please make sure that you have both your ID and a valid Washington Medical Marijuana recommendation in hand and ready for presentation when the delivery person arrives. How the Natural Alternatives delivery system works: You must be a valid Washington Medical Marijuana patient with a legitimate ID. That will be verified immediately. You, the patient, will then decide what strain, concentrate, topical or edible you like from the Natural Alternatives' menu and how much you would like to reimburse. We have a $40 minimum donation and are happy to deliver to the Clark County area. We will not help people who are using medication for reasons other than that allowed by RCW 69.51A.

The Natural Alternatives' menu is continually being updated, so that you don't tire of our selection.

Any donations requested are ONLY compensation for time, nutrients, electricity costs and other factors involved in the process of producing and delivering medical grade marijuana and not toward the sale or purchase of the medicine itself. <strong>NATURES BEST COLLECTIVE'S COMMON QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:</strong> <strong>Question</strong>: I have never used a delivery service before. How does it work? <strong>Answe</strong>r: To become a patient member of Natures Best Collective just give us a call at (619) 252-4620. We will verify that you are a new patient and send one of our drivers to you. Your first visit is just like going to a brick and mortar dispensary in that you need to have your Original Recommendation (the paper not the card) for medicinal cannabis and a valid California ID or Driver License.Our driver will scan those two items for our records. Then you must fill out the Member Agreements and sign the Rules and Regulations. <strong>Question</strong>: I am hesitant to place an order without being able to see the medicine because I don't want to get stuck with inferior medicine. Is it possible for me to inspect the medicine prior to making a donation? <strong>Answer</strong>: Natures Best Collective never make our patients pre-order their medicinal cannabis sight unseen. We show up to you with various strains of medicinal cannabis and you can make your decision by inspecting them, just like you do in a brick and mortar dispensary. If you don't like any of the medicine we have with us you are under no obligation to make a donation. Think of us as a dispensary that is located in your living room or a parking lot near you. <strong>Question</strong>: I am a little uncomfortable about having a delivery because I have snoopy neighbors and I also don't like having strangers in my home. Will the driver show up in a red, gold and green car with marijuana flags and Seedless clothing head to toe or will he be more discreet? <strong>Answer</strong>: Natures Best Collective prides ourselves on being as discreet as possible. All our drivers are Certified Cannabis Technicians and have undergone a criminal background check. We drive regular unmarked cars and we show up to your door with pizza type delivery bags so your snoopy neighbors will just think you are getting a pizza. Please email, call or text message us with any other questions you may have. </p> <p></p>

I would like to address a few things that have been happening at the Markets. We’re just about to number 1400 market days. Over 40,000 patients have visited the markets and we see over 25,000 patient visits each month. Almost every patient and provider is outstanding and helps us provide safe, secure access.</p>  <p>If you’re a patient attending these markets looking for “Weight” please stay away!! <br />We do not allow Bulk transactions. The medicine acquired at these markets is for personal use and not for resale. We will not tolerate resellers </p>  <p>If you are a “Provider” with some scam or looking to hook up on “Volume deals STAY AWAY!!!</p>  <p>We try to bring you the best selection and best quality of medicine available. Remember the Patient Providers and their employees are independent. They do not work for the Market. If you have a problem, we’ll do everything we can to help.</p>  <p>A lot of you know me personally. I’ve personally been at all but a few of our 1400 market days. I’ve fought to stay open and to grow. I’ve worked to provide an atmosphere of Honor, Duty, Service and Fairness to everyone. You know I’m fair and do my best to help everyone associated with the market. We have been assaulted the last few months by bad people looking to do bad things. I’m NOT going to let these people jeopardize the market. With your help I’ll continue to provide the Open, Dynamic environment that you’ve come to know. Thank you to all of our wonderful Patients for you support. Thank you Providers that work diligently each day to assure the Market values are upheld. I will be there for you.</p>  <p>Michael Keysor <br />Owner/ CEO <br />Northwest Cannabis Market <br />America's Only Daily Cannabis Market! <br />2 Locations to Choose From!!</p> <p></p>

Our standard delivery area includes East Sacramento up to the foothills. When placing your order, please check with dispatcher regarding any delivery fees that might apply to your location. <br />Learn more and register as a PHP collective member at our website: http://www.phpwellness.org <br /> Let us bring your medicine to you! Delivery dispensaries are essential for patients who are immobilized or otherwise unable to visit a storefront location. Our delivery volunteers are both professional and discreet. For patients within our service area there is a small delivery fee (usually $5-15). <br /> While we are in the business of helping those who suffer from chronic pain we also understand the pain local families may endure from not having enough to eat. Statistics say that hunger in the United States is at its highest point since 1994 when the USDA started keeping detailed records. Figures released by the U.S. Census Bureau for 2009 indicate that 44 million people, or one in seven, are living at or below the poverty line. PHP Food Bank provides a food pantry on wheels for communities that lack sufficient food assistance programs to meet the need in Sacramento and the Foothill Area. The delivery program is made possible by monthly donations from PHP Wellness and service of our volunteer drivers. In June, 2012 Patients Helping Patients Wellness started a new program: for any non-perishable food donation our patients will receive a discount of $5. We believe that together we can make a difference. <br /> Membership with PHP Wellness is free and the value is exceptional. By avoiding the use of pesticides and other potentially harmful chemicals, we offer safe, clean, and potent medicines. Our best products are lab tested, exquisitely manicured and meticulously weighed to order. Upon receiving your first delivery, our unique brand of quality will be obvious. We offer high-grade bubble hash and honey oil, kief, pre-rolled joints, as well as a variety of edibles and topicals to meet your specific needs. Feel free to ask about our other services available like pre-rolling your order of a specific flower for those who are handicapped.

In addition to the quality of the medicine, patients will be floored by the calming spa like atmosphere as they enter Powell House, the personable nature of everyone from the receptionist to the budtender, and the education and knowledge of the entire staff on the cannabis industry, trends, and which strains will best help which patient. </p> <p></p>  <p></p> <p>Powell House simply has higher standards than most medical dispensaries, and this is evident from the fact that they only offer the best handcrafted cannabis, that they actually throw away product if it falls on the ground, that every effort is made towards cleanliness, and that they want to build a lasting relationship with every patient and genuinely help them live better lives. In the end, when people tell their friends about Powell House, they’ll be raving about how Powell House managed to create a comfortable environment that efficiently provides the best handcrafted cannabis for an affordable price. </p> <p></p>

How do I get my OMMP card? <br />A: Go to a local, alternative medical clinic or another provider with your chart notes (records) for the last 3 doctors' visits for your condition (which includes but is not limited to; Chronic Severe Pain, Chronic Nausea, Chronic Muscle Spasms, Glaucoma, Cancer, AIDS/HIV, Arthritis, Asthma, Hepatitis C, Cachexia, Crohn's disease, GERD, IBS, Multiple Sclerosis, ALS, Neuropathy, Seizure Disorders, Parkinson's disease), and they will guide you. <br />4. Why is Rip City Remedies the spot for me? <br />A: We are completely within the law and are advised and backed by some of the leading Oregon Medical Marijuana Program lawyers. We also protect you and ourselves by being strict about wording and lingo used on our ads and during our interactions with you. We know the law and we make sure we are always within it. We also provide medically lab tested flowers, that are always organically grown for quality and safety for the health our patients. Non-organic and pesticide use can be harmful and counteract the medical qualities of marijuana products. </p>  <p>5. Can I buy meds? <br />THERE IS NO BUYING OR SELLING OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA ALLOWED IN THE STATE OF OREGON AT THIS TIME! <br />A: As the law currently stands, no one may purchase or sell marijuana in Oregon and still be protected by OMMP law. The grower may be reimbursed by a patient for costs associated with growing, but not for time or effort. We will correct anyone that uses any terms referencing sales/buying of Medical Marijuana and refuse service to anyone that does not follow our simple rules. <br />6. Can I donate meds? <br />A: Yes, if you are a grower/patient that grows your own meds for you or your patient, and they have signed contracts allowing your to disperse the excess meeds to help others who cannot produce their own. We prefer to work on a reimbursement basis. </p>  <p>7. If I already have a grower can I still use your service? <br />A: Yes, our service is perfect for those that already have a grower but haven't gotten meds yet. Our service does not interfere with your current arrangements for meds and is only an additional option for receiving the help you need. </p>  <p>8. If I am not an OMMP patient or am part of an out of state medical marijuana program, may I use your service? <br />A: Unfortunately for your protection and ours our service is only available to valid card holding OMMP patients that are Oregon residents with proof of ID. </p>  <p>9. What is the minimum and maximum amount of meds I can be donated or reimburse for through your service? <br />A: We have no minimun and a maximum of 28 grams (under 1 ounce) for first time patients. Trusted patients will then be able to be given the max amount we can provide at that time, and the maximum that OMMP law allows. </p>  <p>10. I'm too sick to meet people; can someone get my meds for me? <br />A: Our service is only for valid OMMP patients, but we offer our service to valid OMMP caregivers that have their card for those patients too sick or unable to get meds, they must have their Caregivers card and valid Oregon ID. </p>  <p>11. Can you give me clones/cuts/starts, and/or can I reimburse you for them? <br />A: Yes, for patients that need help getting started growing their own, we can get pest and disease free clones upon request. </p>  <p>12. Will you grow my meds for me? <br />A: At this time we have the maximum amount of cards you can have per grower, but we will potentially offer this as a service in the future for those that can't grow their own meds and are willing to sign a contract. </p>  <p>13. Do I get added to a list, do you keep records, and what do you do to protect my confidentiality? <br />A: No we do not keep a record of your information on file, however, we do check your OMMP ID and regular ID every time you come in. </p> <p></p>

7456:::SPARC SF:::<p></p> <p> SPARC is a nonprofit collective dedicated to providing, affordable, high quality cannabis and subsidized health services to our members. We aim to educate our patients about cannabis treatments and other alternative health approaches to supplement their medicine. SPARC advocates for government change. We seek to be a voice for the implementation of best practices for the regulation and taxation of medical cannabis. </p> <p></p>  <p></p> <p> Serving patients since 2001 SPARC began as a collaboration between several small collectives serving distinct patient populations in San Francisco. SPARC's work was focused primarily on serving low-income patients suffering from chronic and terminal illnesses. As our member-base continued to expand through the integration of small patient collectives, we sought a permit from the City of San Francisco to open a central healing center and dispensary. This important step allows us to increase our capacity to serve a wider array of members. Our organization is rooted in the same compassionate, patient-centered service that we have maintained for almost a decade. We work to bring a community-friendly and scientific approach to providing medical cannabis to our members. Your membership with SPARC helps us continue to expand our free health service programs, as well as our subsidized distribution network for seriously ill, low-income patients in San Francisco. We have been providing medical cannabis to critically ill patients in hospice at no cost for almost 10 years. <em><strong>&quot;We are grateful for SPARC's partnership and support. We have seen many patients whose conditions have greatly improved through the use of cannabis for pain management, nausea, harm reduction and other valuable medical uses.&quot; Tim Patriarca, Former Executive Director of Maitri AIDS Hospice</strong></em> As a not for profit organization, our proceeds are reinvested directly into patient services and community activism. As we grow, our advocacy and patient services grow, too </p> <p></p>

Backed by a small group of patient/growers that provide clean top shelf medical grade cannabis to other patients of our collective, all donations accepted by San Joaquin Valley Wellness is invested into these collective patient gardens to provide a consistent supply of there specific grade of medical cannabis, call and join San Joaquin Valley Wellness today and &quot;Continue to grow with us!&quot;</p> <p></p>  <p></p> <p>San Joaquin Valley Wellness strives to carry not just the highest quality cannabis but the cleanest and healthiest medical grade cannabis, we believe are patient growers have accomplished this with a method of growing called &quot;veganic&quot; which is organic growing without the use of animal byproducts such as guanos (various animal feces),bone meal, and blood meal offend used in organic growing. This method of growing insures a complete control of plants during their life cycle allowing grower to have the ability to give plants what they need and flush them out just as quickly, insuring properly flush cannabis. No heavy metals (ex. arsenic), no heavy sediment (build up of organic matter or chemical salts), and NEVER any bud stacking chemicals used. We list descriptions of all menu items but these are meant to be used as a good overview of what the majority of patients experience but every patient is truly different and can experience completely different effects than the majority, that's why we suggest patients take advantage of our mix and match strain deals and try different strains at first to see what best suits their needs. We do not list aroma or taste in description although we insure the finest quality for both but because cannabis is still at perfect curing condition when it is pre bottled it keeps curing as long as seal is not broken, we have seen strains change drastically in aroma and taste after as little as a few days of curing and for this reason we do not list aroma and taste, but we can promise you every strain will be the smoothest cannabis possible and beautiful in all its ways. Drivers carry a sample kit of all of our menu items so that patients can see and smell medatication before purchasing. All 1/8ths are 4 grams, all meds are pre bottled grams and sealed for your protection, all quantity deals are mix and match any strain for the quantity deal price. Tax is included in menu price. Free delivery with minimum donation of $50</p> <p></p>

SCMN has 6 parking spaces shared with Kitchen Express. Please <strong>ENTER</strong> the driveway <strong>between</strong> the<strong> Lucky Dragon Chinese</strong> Restaurant and the <strong>SCMN</strong> building, and <strong>EXIT between SCMN</strong> and the<strong> Big Red Storage Container.</strong> <strong> Please park either Behind the Building, or in Front of the Building, and avoid parking at the Lucky Dragon.</strong> All of our flowers are grown in soil, using only natural products to ensure that your flowers are not only clean and safe, but maintain the highest quality aromas, flavors, and potency imaginable. We do carry a large selection of indoor-grown flowers, but we only work with vendors who use soil as their base medium. <strong>We do not price-cap our medicine.</strong> Although we try to keep our prices under $50 an eighth, we believe that quality should demand an appropriate price. We believe that<strong> price-capping directs growers towards high yields</strong> <strong>rather than high quality.</strong> <strong>As the USDA will not certify Organic Medical Marijuana, Clean Green has become the state standard. Ask for proof the next time anyone claims that their medicine is &quot;Organic&quot;, or &quot;Sustainably Grown in their Natural Environments&quot;. </strong> Santa Cruz Mountain Naturals will soon be providing <em>Massage</em> and <em>Acupuncture</em> Services at a deeply discounted rate to all of our members. <strong>We encourage sustainability; bring your own airtight glass container, and any 1/8th that goes into it will receive a discount</strong> (sorry, no double discounts).

The building was first open as the Mint Saloon back in 1835, then in 1896 it was purchased by Aldoph Coors himself. Records say that Coors beer was dispensed here until 1915. It turned into the Empire Shop where goods were sold by a Fran Richards. Later it had turned into an antique shop, which moved across the street, and now open to the public as a merchant of other fine goods. :) With a population of about 420, and an elevation of 8601', we are always high here in Empire.

Our purpose is to promote and advocate for legal access to medicinal cannabis and cannabis products, and educate patients, physicians and the public about the benifical uses ofmedicinal cannabis and cannabis products. </p> <p></p>  <p></p> <p> HOW TO BECOME A MEMBER To become a member and become eligible to purchase medicinal cannabis products from our society, you must complete our application process.&nbsp; First, read the forms which explain how to&nbsp;Become Eligible to Receive Services. Once you understand our procedures, you must fill out the&nbsp;Membership Application and&nbsp;Members Code of Conduct We ask that your health care practitioner (physician, naturopath, or doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine) complete our&nbsp;Practitioner's Statement of Diagnosis and fax it to us directly from her/his office. (We will also accept Health Canada's Medical Marihuana Access Division authorizations.)&nbsp; Your health care provider will need to see the&nbsp;Letter from T.A.G.G.S. which explains about our organization. They may also require a&nbsp;Medical Information Release Form and then s/he will be able to fax us the&nbsp;Practitioners Statement of Diagnosis While many practitioners recognize the effectiveness of cannabis as a medicine, we realize that there are some who still may feel uncomfortable recommending cannabis or even completing the form. Some of them may fear professional repercussions or may not feel that they have enough knowledge about this herbal medicine. Depending on the condition (see below), a confirmation of diagnosis may be sufficient for membership, as long as the reasons stated for not recommending cannabis use are not of a medical nature.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Release of Information form can be signed and given to your doctor to encourage them to send a confirmation of your medical condition, even if they will not fill in our form. Additionally, you can release your medical practitioner from any potential liability by providing a&nbsp;Health Canada Release Form for Medical Practitioners to your practitioner.&nbsp; In order to maintain the confidentiality of our members and their health care providers, we are not able to refer you to doctors who have signed statements in the past. There are many compassionate doctors out there, and we encourage you to keep trying.&nbsp; After we have received the necessary documentation from your practitioner, and it is confirmed, you will have met the criteria for membership.&nbsp; Conditions for which confirmation of diagnosis only is accepted: </p> <p></p>
1391:::Tahoe Herbal Care Delivery:::<p></p> <p> <strong>Tahoe Herbal Care </strong>has been serving the <strong>Truckee/North Lake Tahoe area for over 4 years</strong>! We are a <strong>TRUE COLLECTIVE</strong>, offering top quality medicinal products that are <strong>HOMEGROWN</strong> right here in our little mountain town. Nearly <strong>100% of our medicine, from flowers to concentrates, tinctures &amp; edibles, come from Truckee/Tahoe locals, </strong>the rest within our watershed. So when you support us<strong>, you are also supporting your greater local community. </strong>We pride ourselves in our long-standing vendor relationships and hope you enjoy the <strong>SUPERIOR QUALITY </strong>of our products that come form a<strong> TRUE COLLECTIVE EFFORT.</strong></p> <p></p>
24633:::Tahoe Meds:::<p></p> <p>(530)BUZ-MEDS - Prices INCLUDE taxes. Satisfaction guaranteed. FREE delivery in Truckee w/ 1/8 contribution. Ask about FREE delivery to Kings Beach, Tahoe City, and Squaw Valley. All orders include a FREE Indica or Sativa Cookie. We are bringing North Lake Tahoe top shelf indoor medicines at bottom shelf prices. Try us out and ask about our FREE two day delivery anywhere in the state.</p> <p></p>  <p></p> <p>Tahoe Meds guarantees your satisfaction with our product! If you do not feel that you got what you ordered or the quality is less than expected, call us up and we'll fix it or give you a 110% refund. We want all our members to be completely satisfied with our service and product. (We reserve the right to prorate refunds based on quantity returned.)</p>  <p>The organizing members of Tahoe Meds waited patiently for an opportunity to bring North Tahoe patients a storefront with low overhead and sane suggested contributions. Many of our patients come from high cost areas with insanely high overhead for storefronts near their primary residences. Those costs get passed right into the price of the medicines they get there. Truckee has relatively low overhead costs that would result in lower costs for patients when they are visiting here.</p>  <p>Our sincere hope was that the California Supreme court would apply a common sense interpretation to proposition 215 by allowing patients like us to associate collectively and cooperatively at a common physical location forcing our city and others to lift outright bans on physical storefronts. Sadly the recent California Supreme court decision (CITY OF RIVERSIDE V INLAND EMPIRE PATIENTS HEALTH AND WELLNESS CENTER, INC., et al) has put that off until we can successfully lobby or City and/or county officials to make this common sense change. It's going to be a while.</p>  <p>In the interim we are here to make same day deliveries of the medicines you need right to your doorstep in North Lake Tahoe and anywhere in the state (but that takes about 48 hours). </p> <p></p>
27644:::Tahoe Organics:::<p></p> <p>530-563-8097. The Best Flower in Tahoe. Organic Indoor Top Shelf Medicine locally grown for you. A unique collective run by a professional organic grower. All prices include tax and delivery. 100% money back guarantee. </p>  <p>Why Organic? Because synthetic fertilizers are derived from mineral salts that have been mined from the earth and then chemically synthesized using fossil fuels to create inorganic fertilizers. Organic nutrients are derived from worm castings, bat guano, hydrolyzed fish, seaweed, molasses, leonardite and naturally occurring minerals like rock phosphate and then rely on bacteria and microbes to mineralize or &quot;break down&quot; these complex organic substances into plant accessible nutrients. Although synthetically grown medicine may have the same appearance, you can't always judge a book by its cover. It's the organic inputs and soil that produce a flower with flavor unmatched by any other growing technique. </p>  <p>We take pride in the cleanliness and quality of the medicine provided at Tahoe Organics. No harmful pesticides, fungicides, insecticides, as well mold and powdery mildew free. Our medicine is dried for seven days on the plant in a perfectly controlled environment then cured for another week after each flower has been perfectly manicured. This allows for a minimum of two weeks before you as the patient receive the product. Offering the strain and the grower who produced it allows the patient to become familiar with a consistent, quality product without fearing they are medicating with an inferior product that could actually be harmful to their health. </p> <p></p>

We are also committed to providing the purest extracts to our patients. We work very closely with some of the worlds best extract artists to make sure the need for top quality extracts is fulfilled; as we have come to know, the best extracts come from the best flowers, no?

The popcorn-sized buds in the sample jar all had a hint of purple under a slathering of sandy-colored crystals. In the shop, I got a strange, fruit-punchy Bubba Kush smell, but at home it had more of a grapey-lavender finish. Smoked, the potent little buds had a sweet, earthy taste and were great for mellowing out and easing anxiety after a stressful day. I also was struck with a mean case of the munchies soon after puffing a bowl, despite the fact that I had just finished a meal. At $25 an eighth, it was a perfect purchase, and one Ive been back for many times.&quot; </p>  <p>When you're the first newspaper pot critic, you end up trying a lot of different bud -- and 2013 was no exception for William Breathes.

25377:::The Healing Gardens Collective:::<p></p> <p>Welcome to The Healing Gardens Collective (A Free Delivery Service)</p>  <p>The Healing Gardens Collective provides safe access to an excellent selection of locally grown medical marijuana, a variety of concentrates, gourmet edibles, lollipops, sodas, seeds, clones, and much more.</p>  <p>The Healing Gardens Collective offers Free Delivery service to its collective members living in Santa Barbara County and Ventura County.</p> <p></p>  <p></p> <p>Marijuana Plants</p>  <p>Sativa and Indica are the two main varieties of the cannabis plant used as medicine. The Sativa strains are more of a stimulant, the Indica strains are more of a relaxant. <br />Sativa</p>  <p>Sativa marijuana plants produce a higher proportion of THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol) than CBD (Cannabidiol) compared to Indica plants. This results in more cerebral, soaring, energetic highs. This can stimulate brain activity and may produce hallucinations. Sativas can help with appetite stimulation, relieving depression, migraines, pain and nausea.</p>  <p>Sativa plants grow tall and thin reaching heights of 20ft in one season. Once they begin to flower they reach maturity within 10-16 weeks. They have less chlorophyll than Indica plants and take longer to grow and mature. They also require more light. The yield of a Sativa plant is lower than that of Indicas, but it is very potent. Its flavor ranges from earthy to sweet and fruity. <br />Indica</p>  <p>Indica marijuana plants are essentially the opposite of Sativas. They produce higher levels of CBD than THC resulting in a much heavier, sleepy type of high. The relaxing qualities of Indica strains allow them to be effective for anxiety, pain, nausea, appetite stimulation, sleep, muscle spasms and tremors, among other symptoms.</p>  <p>Indica plants are short and dense with broad leaves. Their higher chlorophyll content results in a shorter growing season with higher yields than Sativas. Once flowering starts they mature in 6 to 8 weeks. The buds are thick and dense, with flavors and aromas ranging from pungent skunk to sweet and fruity. <br />Hybrid</p>  <p>Hybrids are a combination of different Indicas, different Sativas or combinations of the two. How the resulting hybrid strains grow, mature and smoke depends upon the Indica/Sativa percentages they end up containing. </p> <p></p>

No one has ever died from a marijuana overdose, and marijuana has a wide variety of therapeutic applications. Marijuana is frequently beneficial in the treatment of serious medical conditions. Medical marijuana has been deemed legitimate (by at least one court, legislature, and/or government agency in the United States) for treatment of the following medical conditions: AIDS/HIV, Cancer, Glaucoma, Multiple Sclerosis, Scleroderma, Chronic Pain, Nausea, Anxiety, Seizure Disorder Insomnia, Eating Disorders and Crohn's Disease just to name a few. Medical marijuana is the safest and most effective medicine known to mankind. Marijuana is significantly safer than all of the following substances: Aspirin, Advil, Alcohol, Tobacco. Studies have demonstrated that cannabis has analgesic effects in pain conditions secondary to injury (e.g. spinal cord injury) or disease (e.g. HIV disease, HIV drug therapy) of the nervous system. This suggests that cannabis may provide a treatment option for those individuals who do not respond or respond inadequately to currently available therapies. The efficacy of cannabis in treatment-refractory patients also may suggest a novel mechanism of action not fully exploited by current therapies. In addition to nerve pain, CMCR has also supported a study on muscle spasticity in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Such spasticity can be painful and disabling, and some patients do not benefit optimally from existing treatments. The results of the CMCR study suggest that cannabis reduces MS spasticity, at least in the short term, beyond the benefit available from usual medical care.&quot; Source: Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research, &quot;Report to the Legislature and Governor of the State of California presenting findings pursuant to SB847 which created the CMCR and provided state funding,&quot; University of California, (San Diego, CA: February 2010), p. 2. <strong>Indications of Medical Marijuana Therapy: </strong> Chronic pain, Arthritis, Migraine headaches, Glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, Cancer, Post chemo or radiation therapy, Chronic nausea/vomiting, Anorexia (loss of appetite), Depressiony, Anxiety disorder, Multiple sclerosis, Insomnia, Premenstrual syndrome, Seizure disorders, Eating disorders (Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa),Gastric Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Cerebral palsy, Muscle spasm, Asthma, And many more&acirc;€&brvbar;&acirc;€&brvbar; Cannabis growing recommendation is available for indicated patients <strong>Contra-indications: </strong> Schizophrenia, Bipolar disease, Psychotic disease, Severe heart disease. </p> <p></p>

It does not include the mature stalks of the plant, fiber produced from the stalks, oil or cake made from the seeds of the plant, any other compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the mature stalks (except the resin extracted therefrom), fiber, oil, or cake, or the sterilized seed of the plant which is incapable of germination&quot; (H&amp;SC 11018).</p>  <p>2/15/2010 - An excellent review of clinical studies on the medical use of cannabis and cannIbinoids has been published by Arno Hazekamp and Franjo Grotenhermen. The authors summarize 37 different controlled studies in the period July 1, 2005 - August 1, 2009. Eight specifically involved smoked marijuana, all of which indicated medical efficacy. Conditions treated included chronic pain, HIV neuropathy, spinal cord injury, and Hep C. The authors add that at least 110 studies on medical cannabis have been published since 1975. So much for the notion that our drug bureaucrats need more studies on medical marijuana. </p> <p></p>

With decades of experience behind them, the Verde team focuses on each individual harvest, maintaining strict standards of quality and sanitation. Verde focuses on providing their patients with a healthy variety of proven strains, opposed to inundating them with mundane choices of sub-par production or low-potency genetics. The strain selection may seem humble compared to some; this is intentional. Each strain is specifically chosen for it's superior genetic traits, and only select phenotypes are used to produce medicine. Then, the cultivation environment is dialed in for each particular strain, revealing the unique qualities that each has to offer. Quality control is maintained throughout the cultivation, transportation, storage and presentation of the medicine. We ensure no degradation of the product through machine-trimming or compressed storage, quick drying or curing, air or heat damage. Nothing is displayed on the shelves except the highest grades. If we feel any harvest is less-than-the-best, we do not offer it to our patients. This dedication to quality-only product allows new patients to make a safe decision, regardless of their knowledge of art of Cannabis, and provides a &quot;no-bull&quot; selection for more experienced patients. </p> <p></p>

Well, here’s ours, we came up with the name Weedidit because through all the adversities that life can bring one’s way “We Did It”, we pushed through and never lost our vision to help patients who were in need of marijuana for medicinal purpose.</p>  <p>A few years ago I injured my back that required me to have back surgery. After being on narcotic pain medication for almost a year, I told myself there has to be a better way to ease my chronic pain. After all, they are harmful to the body. Eating away at your liver and other organs, especially if you have other illnesses such as me like diabetes and high blood pressure. Then a friend told me about medical marijuana, I did my research and discovered that marijuana was good for my chronic pain and neuropathy in my legs due to my injury. For anyone who deals with chronic pain, you know that not only do you deal with physical pain you also deal with mental pain. Marijuana helps with my anxiety, depression and insomnia.</p>  <p>I wish that I had thought about medical marijuana a long time ago. It could have helped my mother who died from lung cancer several years ago with the pain she was having due to chemotherapy and radiation. My nephew did several tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and suffers from PTSD. He had been given numerous prescription medications which nothing worked until he tried medical marijuana.</p>  <p>Medical marijuana is believed to be good for over 200 ailments such as stuttering, insomnia, premenstrual syndrome, preventing nausea and vomiting in cancer patients, increasing appetite, relieving pain, preventing blindness from glaucoma, control epileptic seizures, stops cancer from spreading, decrease anxiety, slows progression of Alzheimer’s disease, relieves arthritis discomfort, and the list goes on and on.</p>  <p>Weedidit Association vision is to provide cannabis based edibles and flowers to chronically ill or pained patients who have received a doctor’s prescription. We work directly with patients and service providers, such as doctor’s offices, clinics and hospice centers to deliver safe, reliable cannabis products.</p>  <p>Genesis 1:29</p>  <p>And God saith, ‘Lo, I have given to you every herb sowing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in which is the fruit of tree sowing seed, to you it is for food; Every herb bearing seed and tree bearing fruit is granted to man for his sustenance.</p> <p></p>
