That's the typical dispensary and claim its &quot;TOP SHELF&quot;. Greedy feeble attempts to &quot;control&quot; their product while growing massive illegal amounts and requiring no indoor energy expenses while sacrificing the fine TRUE Indoor quality. You will notice the difference with us. From the attitude to the quality. 7 Leaf Clover Medical Inc., certified botanist grow teams have over 40+ years of practice making perfect indoor award winning products. Each one of our Exotic strains is literally picture perfect and inspected under microscope.</p>  <p>WHY 7 Leaf Clover Medical (SLC INC.)?</p>  <p>1. EXCLUSIVE. Yes theirs always someone higher to answer to financially...You will deal with only ONE person, one on one. ME! I'm C.J, yes the one who manages. Highly trained in the medical field; I give time to sit down and talk to each patient to determine whats best for their needs. Being a small collective is great which gives more focus on YOU, and our local towns needs. Quality over quantity system.</p>  <p>2. KNOWLEDGE &amp; CARE. What strain is best for your situation. What strain is packed with the highest levels of cannabinoids determine its function and effect out the 85 of them. We want to get everyone off prescription pills and replace it with our enhanced strains as a natural alternative. We focus on MEDICAL patients with chronic illnesses+mental diseases, and not for profit. Our goal is to be more involved with our community, make friends, hire vets, and to create legal, local jobs, for the individuals that can't get work. SLC Incs, ultimate goal is to independently raise money for cancer research using CBD &amp; working with Abbott Laboratories, in Orange. We hope to get an FDA approval. Check out our pure CDB capsules, THC capsules, opium narcotic withdrawal balls, custom shatter Oil cartridges, and cleaner co2 extracts.</p>  <p>3. HONESTY. Give caregivers a good name. ALL of our strains are top shelf and sometimes literally dense as rocks, or its turned into wax. What you see is what you will get. Sticky trichomes yet dry cured terpene works of art. All of our pictures are taken from our actual current batch of meds, not old or commercial photos. </p>  <p>4. QUALITY. ALL of the meds are Cannabis Cup and High Times Winners; grown literally inside sealed co2 Laboratory's enhanced Indoor controlled environment from seed, not clone which insures the genetics and potency. All genetics coming from the best, imported direct- The Netherlands. We also breed our own crosses inside our labs. 7 Leaf Clover meds chooses to grow only Vegan, and all Organic. So NO harsh chemicals for (hydro), hormones, insecticides or sprays ever used so that will give the ultimate in health, taste, and potency all naturally as the difference will show in taste. This is the reason why competitors in high times magazine grow Organically in a super-soil, and not hydro. </p>  <p>5. PASSION. We GO organic, Vegan and 110% GREEN, down to recycling the green medical containers all the way to the ZERO emissions hybrid transportation delivery vehicles &amp; Electric Bike. 7 Leaf Meds focuses on quality over quantity. SLC, prides this method as superior and is best for medicinal uses. We put health first and encourage organic natural alternative western &amp; eastern medicines for the various human medical conditions, over harsh chemically addicting deadly prescription pills. We take the tens of thousands of Exotic strains all over the world and bring them locally. </p>  <p>THE MISSION:</p>  <p> Bringing science into the world of POT. Knowledge and understanding of the present day findings in 2014. How 62 is now 85 cannabinoids, and what the main compounds do medicinally as to how they effect our Mind Body &amp; &quot;Soul&quot;. To show all patients seen by doctors that I will show you the Doctorate/Medical side of the thousands of various cannabis strains and whats best to be prescribed to everyone's unique situation. <br />Our non-profit organization is saving every penny for CBD cancer research and raising funds to open a research facility and a store front. <br /> As a pre med school post grad from La Sierra- Loma Linda University, I take a very scientific approach to the art of horticulture. I Majored in botany, minor in business management. Stayed green 100%; All the way down to the Hybrid-Electric delivery vehicles &amp; Electric bikes delivered locally. I make sure we all use high end (eco-friendly) environmentally safe low energy LED lighting &amp; Solar technology, secret undisclosed Vegan+Organic methods and recipes in order to preserve our patented, unique, rare and affordable top shelf AAA+++ grade flower. 7 Leaf Meds prides on positive energy, honesty, and most important a safe Stealth n' Fast delivery guaranteed. Being exclusive with our products is more important than making a dime.</p>  <p>THE SCIENCE: <br />Phyto-cannabinoids, also known as cannabinoids or exo-cannabinoids, are differentiated from endo-cannabinoids due to their production from enzymes in a plant opposed to being manufactured in a human, or better yet, a mammal. Cannabinoids come in many shapes and functions. Today, there are many known unique phytocannnabinoids and synthetic cannabinoids. Laboratories, like Montana Biotech, are currently assisting in cannabinoid testing. This service can help patients get the most from this ancient plant, cannabis.</p>  <p>Some of the &gt;85 known Phytocannabinoids:</p>  <p>-CBG (Cannabigerol): Non-psychoactive, sleep inducing. Anti-microbial (Immune-System boost). Lowers intra-ocular pressure (IOP) Glaucoma.</p>  <p>-CBC (Cannabichromene): Sedative effect. Moderates effects of THC. Analgesic (pain relieving). Non-psychoactive.</p>  <p>THCV (Tetrahydrocannabivarin): Stronger, faster “high” effect. Apatite suppressant. Euphoria, analgesic (pain relieving).</p>  <p>-THC (tetrahydrocannabinol): Psychotropic. Analgesic (pain relieving). Apatite stimulant. Bronchial dilator. Lowers IOP/glaucoma.</p>  <p>-CBD (Cannabidiol): Non-psychoactive. Reduces muscle spasms. Muscle relaxant. Analgesic (pain relieving) </p>  <p>-CBN (Cannabinol): Virtually Non-psychoactive. Non-narcotic analgesic (pain relieving). Good indication of medications age.</p>  <p>Source: Trends in Pharmacological Sciences <br />Volume 30, Issue 10, October 2009, Pages 515-527</p> <p></p>

Our friendly, compassionate and knowledgeable staff will help you find the best medication for your needs.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Interest in medical marijuana is growing steadily, fanned by a large political movement that aims to increase its availability and legality. But what's it actually good for? Inaccurate, uncited memes claiming its efficacy in treating everything from cancer to epilepsy travel on social media like wildfire, but what does the science actually say? </p>  <p>Marijuana, or Cannabis sativa, is an annual plant originally from Central Asia that has been used for medicinal purposes for at least 3,000 years. The biologically active compounds found in the plant are called cannabinoids; at least 66 have been identified so far. These interact with two types of receptor; CB1 receptors which are found predominantly on cells in the brain and spinal cord, and CB2 which are found in various immune cells. The most potent cannabinoid is thought to be delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).</p>  <p>It is thought that cannabinoids may be useful in treating a variety of ailments, namely glaucoma, pain, nausea, muscle spasms and loss of appetite. It is also being investigated in cancer patients as a way to alleviate the side effects of cancer therapy, but some laboratory tests are also investigating antitumor properties. </p>  <p>Stimulating Appetite</p>  <p>Cannabinoids such as THC have been shown in numerous animal studies to increase food consumption and some human trials have also shown positive results. For example, a study comparing THC with a placebo in cancer patients found that those taking THC had a better appetite and sense of taste, and although they didn’t consume more calories they felt more relaxed and had a better quality of sleep compared to the placebo group. Another study investigating the FDA-approved synthetic cannabinoid (THC) drug dronabinol in HIV/AIDS patients presenting weight loss found that those taking THC ate more than controls and stopped losing weight. However, in a study comparing dronabinol with a standard drug (megestrol) in cancer patients presenting loss of appetite, researchers found that dronabinol was not as effective as megestrol in increasing appetite or weight gain.</p>  <p>No surprises here, but a study in healthy people found that those inhaling marijuana consumed more calories (had “the munchies”), especially from fatty and sugary snacks, than those inhaling a placebo.</p>  <p>How does it stimulate appetite? The CB1 receptor is active in numerous areas of the body that are known to stimulate eating behavior, such as the hypothalamus and limbic forebrain, and also certain areas in the stomach and intestine. THC can exert effects by mimicking endogenous substances (called endocannabinoids) that are naturally found in the body.</p>  <p>Nausea and Vomiting</p>  <p>There have been numerous studies investigating the ability of cannabinoids to reduce and nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy. A 2001 systematic review of 30 studies involving synthetic cannabinoids (dronabinol, nabilone or levonantradol) compared with a placebo or an active control (a non-cannabinoid drug) found that the cannabinoids were more effective than the active control or the placebo at reducing vomiting and nausea. Furthermore, patients demonstrated a preference for the cannabinoid drugs over the placebo and the active control drugs, and they presented limited side-effects.</p>  <p>How do they work? The endocannabinoid system (the name for the group of molecules and receptors such as CB1 and CB2 that are collectively involved in a variety of physiological processes and mediating the psychoactive effects of marijuana) is key to modulating numerous systems such as reward pathways, pain perception and emesis (vomiting). Areas of the brain involved in chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting are higher cortical and limbic regions that can influence the stimulation or suppression of nausea and vomiting. CB1 receptors are found in high quantities in these areas, and drugs such as nabilone can agonize these receptors.</p>  <p>Pain Relief</p>  <p>While neither nabilone nor dronabinol are FDA approved for pain management, a few studies have shown that they may be beneficial. For example, a small 2010 study carried out by McGill University Health Centre investigated 21 adults with post-traumatic or postsurgical neuropathic pain. Participants were randomly assigned to receive cannabis at 4 potencies (0%, 2.5%, 6% or 9.4% THC) which was smoked at home three times a day. All participants used all four potencies, which were rotated throughout the duration of the study. Participants recorded pain intensity and also mood, sleep and quality of life. They found that cannabis smoked at a concentration of 9.4% THC moderately reduced pain and improved sleep, with few side-effects. Larger studies are needed to verify these results.</p>  <p>A 2007 study carried out by researchers from the University of California at San Francisco looked at HIV patients with peripheral neuropathy and found that a significantly higher number of patients receiving the treatment (smoking marijuana) experienced a reduction in pain compared with the placebo group.</p>  <p>Glaucoma</p>  <p>Glaucoma is a condition caused by an increase in pressure within the eye which can lead to blindness if left untreated. Cannabinoids effectively lower intraocular pressure (IOP), likely by increasing ocular blood flow through their vasorelaxant properties, and there have been a few studies since the 1970’s investigating cannabis as a possible treatment for glaucoma. For example, an early and small trial in 1971 demonstrated that smoking marijuana reduced IOP but the effects only lasted 3-4 hours, limiting its usefulness when taken in this manner. However, studies have shown that while marijuana may temporarily reduce IOP, it also lowers blood pressure throughout the body, canceling out the beneficial effects.</p>  <p>A 1999 report by the Institute of Medicine concluded that despite the observed reduction in IOP by cannabinoids and marijuana, “…the effect is too short lived and required too high doses, and there are too many side effects to recommend lifelong use in the treatment of glaucoma. The potential harmful effects of chronic marijuana smoking outweigh its modest benefits in the treatment of glaucoma.”</p>  <p>Epilepsy</p>  <p>Epilepsy, which is a neurological disorder characterized by episodic seizures, affects around 2.3 million Americans, almost half of whom live with uncontrolled seizures. The use of marijuana to treat epilepsy has a complex history. Some animal studies have demonstrated that THC can control seizures that are unresponsive to other treatments, whereas a few have also shown that it might trigger seizures. So far, there exists only one published human clinical trial demonstrating the effectiveness of marijuana in the treatment of epilepsy which was conducted in 1980 and involved only 16 participants. Half of the individuals receiving cannabidiol remained almost free of convulsions throughout the study, and a further 3 demonstrated some improvement in their condition. Only one of the placebo recipients improved.</p>  <p>Recent preclinical studies carried out by the University of Reading identified a particular marijuana compound that showed great promise in the treatment of epilepsy as it helped to reduce convulsions and was well-tolerated. To take this forward, a British pharmaceutical company called GW Pharmaceuticals announced last September that it would be initiating a Phase 1 Clinical Trial of a non-psychoactive cannabinoid called GWP42006 in the treatment of epilepsy. </p>  <p>Anecdotal evidence for the success of marijuana in controlling seizures from epilepsy sufferers also spurred a senator in the U.S. to put forward a bill allowing people in South Carolina to use CBD oil to treat epilepsy, which was passed into law two days ago. </p>  <p>Muscle Tension and Spasm</p>  <p>It has been suggested that marijuana may be able to help control both muscle stiffness and spasms, but the results are conflicting.</p>  <p>In 2001, a large placebo-controlled trial was initiated in Britain which set out to investigate marijuana in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. 630 people with different forms of MS were enrolled, and although the study found that oral derivatives or marijuana did not provide objective improvements in spasticity (as measured by physicians), the patients reported feeling improvements in spasticity and pain. Based on these results, a further study was initiated to investigate whether dronabinol slows the progression of MS. The study, which was published in Lancet Neurology, found that dronabinol did not positively affect (slow) disease progression.</p>  <p>However, a 2013 study led by the same researcher investigating 400 individuals with MS found that muscle stiffness improved by almost twofold in the cannabis group when compared with the placebo group.</p>  <p>Therefore, some inconsistencies remain in data and medics are currently unsure as to whether the benefits outweigh the side effects.</p>  <p>Autoimmune Diseases</p>  <p>A very recent study, published in The Journal of Biological Chemistry, has suggested that THC can suppress the immune system of rodents through epigenetic modifications (changes in gene expression that do not involve changes in DNA sequence), raising the possibility that it could be used to treat autoimmune diseases such as arthritis and multiple sclerosis. However, it is certainly early days yet and further investigation is warranted since the study left many questions unanswered, for example how long the effects of THC last for. Furthermore, their results also hinted that the infamous BRCA2 gene may be suppressed by THC. This tumor suppressor gene produces a protein involved in DNA repair, so we certainly don't want to be suppressing its activities as this can lead to cancer. </p>  <p>Antitumor Properties</p>  <p>There have been numerous laboratory and animal-based studies that have shown antitumor properties of cannabis, or more specifically THC. In particular, several studies have shown that cannabinoid administration can prevent the growth of cultured brain cancer cells and tumor xenografts (human tumor tissue transplanted into animals) in rodents, including gliomas (brain cancers derived from glial cells). One study investigating the most aggressive glioma, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which is also notoriously resistant to anticancer therapies, found that THC in combination with the conventional GBM therapy (temozolomide) exerted strong antitumor activities in mice with glioma xenografts. They also found that administering submaximal doses of THC and cannabidiol, another cannabinoid, together with temozolomide reduced the growth of both temozolomide-sensitive and temozolomide-resistant tumors in animal models.</p>  <p>Although no human studies (in the medical field) have yet been carried out on cancer and cannabis, the promising results gathered so far from cell culture and animal studies prompted researchers to initiate the first human trials using cannabis to treat GBM. The small pilot study will involve a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled phase with 20 patients investigating cannabinoids in combination with temozolomide. Results have not yet been published.</p>  <p>A 2007 Harvard study investigating THC also found that non-toxic doses of the cannabinoid inhibited the growth and spread of lung tumor cell lines and also reduced tumor size in mice with human lung cancer xenografts when compared with a control group. However, the researchers cautioned that they did not know the exact mechanisms behind this and that further investigation is needed since some studies have actually shown that THC can stimulate some cancers. For example, a 2000 study published in the Journal of Immunology found that THC promoted lung tumor growth in mice by impeding the body’s antitumor system. </p>  <p>There are many websites which state that “cannabis cures cancer”- it doesn’t. As demonstrated, cannabis may have many potential applications in medicine, and laboratory and animal studies have yielded some promising results with regards to cancer. But cancer is not one single disease, and saying it is a “cure” is wrong, especially due to conflicting results and the fact that studies so far regarding antitumor properties have not been conducted in humans. </p>  <p>If you'd like to find out more, check out this great review of cannabis studies conducted for a variety of medical conditions.</p>  <p>Marijuana is a fascinating plant, with a wide range of uses. Its use in medicine is currently being researched all around the world, and there are many situations in which it can be helpful. However, anything being touted as a &quot;miracle&quot; cure for anything should be treated with suspicion. There is no such thing as a miracle, and everything that has an effect also has side-effects. The positives and negatives to every treatment must be carefully weighed up. It is also important to not overstate the importance of laboratory and animal models - while useful and scientifically interesting, they do not prove anything with regards to human treatment. Long term, human trials are required before we can state definitively how useful medical marijuana is in treating each of these illnesses.</p>  <p>http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/medical-marijuana-what%E2%80%99s-it-good</p> <p></p>

LOW PRICE TOP-SHELF MEDICINE ALWAYS! <br />_____________________________________________________________________ <br />Specials we ALWAYS have going on:</p>  <p>*We PRICE MATCH against other San Diego DELIVERY SERVICES on all industry standard products for an equal donation price at the time of your order, or APC credit on a future order. Please inquire for details.</p>  <p>*REVIEWS/REFERRALS: APC always gives away FREE TOP-SHELF pre-rolls for reviews OR referrals with verification of the user name on our review page, and/or patient's name whom you referred. Please also try and have the patient say who referred them at the time of their first order. TOP-SHELF pre-rolls are chosen by the staff and will not be listed on our regular $10 pre-roll menu ... these pre-rolls will be from our $20 gram menu and are well worth the effort!</p>  <p>*STUDENTS: $5 OFF your entire donation order every SUNDAY with proof of ANY valid college ID.</p>  <p>*VETS: 10% OFF every donation order up to $10 off total! </p>  <p>*SENIORS: $5 OFF your entire donation order every SUNDAY (Valid 60 years and older).</p>  <p>*FIRST TIME PATIENTS (FTPs): A free gift with every order updated regularly on our menu page!

We also provide one copy for you and we hang on to the other copy.</p>  <p>*RETURN PATIENTS: Free extra gift included with every donation, every time! </p>  <p>_______________________________________________________________________ <br />FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS: </p>  <p>Can I combine strains (Mix N' Match) and get the discounted larger quantity price? <br />YES! EXAMPLE: Let's say you want two different strains of a half ounce each, totaling a full ounce in quantity for your donation. Some collectives charge per half ounce a la carte ... but not APC!! We apply the &quot;bulk discount&quot; price to various combinations of patient donations. If the prices vary between desired strains, APC uses a formula suited to give YOU, the patient, the best and most importantly, fairest donation price! </p>  <p>Do you offer any veteran or senior discounts? <br />YES! Veterans receive 10% off up to $10!! Seniors can enjoy SENIOR SUNDAY! Anyone over the age of 62 qualifies for $5 off their entire order EVERY sunday! ** Please note, for all special discounts valid proof is required, thank you!*</p>  <p>Do I need a California I.D. to be a member with APC? <br />No, you do not need a California I.D., however, proof of residency IS required in lieu of a CA I.D. This can be in the form of: A lease agreement, any DMV document, or utility bills. Student I.D.'s are not acceptable forms of residency. </p>  <p>Do I need a doctor's recommendation to order from APC? <br />Yes! PLEASE have ALL of your information handy before placing your call. This includes your current CALIFORNIA doctor's recommendation, as well as your driver's license and proof of residency if you are an out-of-state patient. Unfortunately, state law forbids us from accepting patients with out of state doctor's recommendations (Ex. Arizona). We can refer you to local San Diego doctors, though!</p>  <p>What Should I Order? <br />APC's up to date offerings are online here on WeedMaps under the menu tab. Having a general idea of your order doesn't hurt when placing your call, although, our office staff is happy to help with any and all of your questions or concerns. We strive to offer you the best recommendation based on your medicinal needs. We take pride in our expertise on cannabis.</p>  <p>Do you have clones? <br />Often we do, updated regularly on the menu! We typically have many clones at various life-cycle stages available for same-day delivery! Please note however, that the availability of certain strains depends on popularity at the given time and some strains may require a pre-order. Placing a call to APC never hurts though, so feel free to phone in with any questions about clones.</p>  <p>How far is your delivery radius? Why the charge? <br />APC has a 15 mile delivery RADIUS. Any patient wishing to place an order outside of that 15 mile radius can still be serviced with the same great quality medicine, however the donation of a variable delivery fee applies (based upon mileage). This fee goes towards the driver's gas for the minimum 30+ mile round trip from our office, to you, and back, to bring you the same great meds we offer to most of central san diego county. Again, we are a collective working TOGETHER towards the same goals.</p>  <p>____________________________________________________________________________ <br />By contacting APC, you the patient are acknowledging the following: <br />I am a California resident age 18 or older. I have a written recommendation for the use of medical cannabis from my doctor under Prop 215. I am not a law enforcement officer, nor a postal inspector, or operating under an assumed name or in cooperation with any criminal investigation; nor am I seeking out evidence which may serve as the basis for any charge of violating federal, state, or local laws. I will not use the medication provided for any non-medicinal purposes. Anyone who uses the provided medication for any purposes what so ever, will be assuming their own liability, and are responsible for their own actions. Any donations requested are only compensation for time, nutrients, electricity costs and other factors involved in the process of producing and delivering medical grade marijuana and not toward the sale or purchase of the medicine itself. This information is intended for doctor recommended patients in compliance w/Prop 215 and S.B. 420, California Health and Safety Code Section 11362.5 and 11362.7 et seq. and all local regulations. APC has the right to refuse service to anyone, and may request additional verification details prior to delivery. It is in your best interest to remember that APC is a working collective and together we must be tolerant and patient of each's others questions, concerns, and otherwise rights of individuality.</p> <p></p>

Well, here’s ours, we came up with the name Weedidit because through all the adversities that life can bring one’s way “We Did It”, we pushed through and never lost our vision to help patients who were in need of marijuana for medicinal purpose.</p>  <p>A few years ago I injured my back that required me to have back surgery. After being on narcotic pain medication for almost a year, I told myself there has to be a better way to ease my chronic pain. After all, they are harmful to the body. Eating away at your liver and other organs, especially if you have other illnesses such as me like diabetes and high blood pressure. Then a friend told me about medical marijuana, I did my research and discovered that marijuana was good for my chronic pain and neuropathy in my legs due to my injury. For anyone who deals with chronic pain, you know that not only do you deal with physical pain you also deal with mental pain. Marijuana helps with my anxiety, depression and insomnia.</p>  <p>I wish that I had thought about medical marijuana a long time ago. It could have helped my mother who died from lung cancer several years ago with the pain she was having due to chemotherapy and radiation. My nephew did several tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and suffers from PTSD. He had been given numerous prescription medications which nothing worked until he tried medical marijuana.</p>  <p>Medical marijuana is believed to be good for over 200 ailments such as stuttering, insomnia, premenstrual syndrome, preventing nausea and vomiting in cancer patients, increasing appetite, relieving pain, preventing blindness from glaucoma, control epileptic seizures, stops cancer from spreading, decrease anxiety, slows progression of Alzheimer’s disease, relieves arthritis discomfort, and the list goes on and on.</p>  <p>Weedidit Association vision is to provide cannabis based edibles and flowers to chronically ill or pained patients who have received a doctor’s prescription. We work directly with patients and service providers, such as doctor’s offices, clinics and hospice centers to deliver safe, reliable cannabis products.</p>  <p>Genesis 1:29</p>  <p>And God saith, ‘Lo, I have given to you every herb sowing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in which is the fruit of tree sowing seed, to you it is for food; Every herb bearing seed and tree bearing fruit is granted to man for his sustenance.</p> <p></p>

23461:::BombBudz Collective:::<p></p> <p>I Have been an avid smoker longer than I should mention. I Just wanted to go to the clubs and get a larger donation once a week, but it seems they are geared more toward the gram/eight every other day kind of smokers. I just want to get my limit each week and be done with it. After looking around for some time, I decided the care clubs were not the answer. I came across a collective of growers/patients at one of the local markets. They ask for a smaller donation in exchange for the repeat donations. If you are looking to get your meds on a more regular, less often basis, While saving a great deal, text me or call me and we can discuss the details.</p> <p></p>

The donation amounts reflected on our menu are accurate, as such please review it carefully before calling to place your order. <br />If all of these instuctions are carefully followed, you will find this to be one of the easiest calls you've ever made! </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The rating system is just my personal opinion and everyone's experience with different strains, and mainly different grows can be different. Anytime I rate anything I tend to be on the low side, my pain scale, 10 is dead, 9 and 8 is hospital, 6 can't work. You get the picture. Quality just as tough, my 5 star would be Cannabis Cup winners and contenders. Now excepting NEW VENDORS. Please contact by email only with products and services, if interested I will contact you. Especially interested in Edibles and Concentrates. </p> <p></p>

29485:::CAM Recreational:::<p></p> <p>CAM is now open to recreational customers ! </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Colorado Alternative Medicine (CAM) opened up a second store in early 2014 shortly after Amendment 64 passed allowing Recreational Dispensaries to sell Marijuana to adults 21+. Exercising our Constitutional rights and bringing a natural homeopathic option to our customers is something we’re proud to be a part of. We follow all rules and regulations set forth by the Colorado MMED and require all of our customers to have a valid state ID in order to purchase anything from our facility. CAM Recreational offers the same quality medication found in our Medical Dispensary for patients who don’t have their Medical Marijuana Card or are visiting from out of State. </p>  <p> Our Medical Dispensary was established in 2009 by a sole entrepreneur with a talent for growing top quality marijuana and the ambition to create her dream into reality. The result of that dream coming into fruition was opening up her own Dispensary with high potency marijuana. The products we provide for our Recreational customers are upheld to the same standard of quality we require for our Medical patients. Everything that we provide is grown in house hydroponically with attention to the care and quality of each plant from the very start. Our staff is comprised of enthusiastic individuals with a vast knowledge and fiery passion for growing, harvesting, and educating patients so they can medicate effectively and efficiently. We take great pride in the work we do, always remembering that some good old fashioned TLC goes a long way.</p>  <p> If you are interested in visiting our Recreational Dispensary it is conveniently located at 2394 South Broadway in Denver Colorado. We are open Monday-Saturday from 11am until 7pm and on Sundays from Noon until 5pm. You can call us at 720-420-0314 if you have any questions.

The ONLY collective in San Diego that tests ALL strains for potency and pathogens! Always consistent, best quality medicine available, lab tested and 100% safe for human consumption. Give us a try you won't go back to anything else. First time patient bonus: 1.0 grams medicine, your choice! Call 760-688-2867 </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> Our collective focuses on quality, consistency, and most importantly the safety of our patients. Many patients do not know of the major health concerns caused by improperly grown medical marijuana. Lab testing proves that most medical marijuana on the market today still has pesticides and fertilizers present and can be toxic to human health. Our medical marijuana is grown indoor with methods unconventional to most growers today. All air coming into our indoor gardens is UV treated to prevent mold and pathogens We use a full spectrum of light that is not provided by high pressure sodium or metal halide bulbs. Our focus is not on the power of our lights (watts, lumens). Instead we ensure that all our plants are provided with a full spectrum of light that parallels our sun. To create the safest medicine available our growers only add water to the plants life cycle for the last four weeks. No pesticides are ever used while our plants have started their blooming or flowering stage. Lab tests prove that all harmful pesticides and chemicals have been removed from our final product. When medical marijuana is grown properly under the right conditions it is a wonderful, clean, safe, all-natural medicine. The best medical marijuana strains available today are low-yielding strains. Within the industry we find growers are quick to talk about how much yield or product that they can produce off each plant. It's simple for many growers to focus on the money the plant can provide rather then the best possible medicine. We don't focus on yield. Our growers are dedicated to quality and perfecting the genetics of their plants. When you focus on these aspects you create only the best plants and medicine possible. We let the results of our hard work and dedication speak for themselves. </p>  <p>We are in full compliance with California state law and guidelines. You must have valid California drivers license or I.D. card, and current doctor's recommendation or valid California MMIC card. Verification is quick and easy over the phone.

Smokes heavy and it creeps takes ahwile to get going but in the end very clear and energetic high. <strong>RP Headband: </strong>The high is not too overpowering, and lasts a long time, making it good utility daytime smoke. Headband is good for reducing anxiety. <strong> </strong> <strong>OG 18: </strong>The high feels like a bubble has been stretched around you. When the bubble pops, it is as if the high caused time to warp.OG #18 optimal for focused leisure such as playing video games, but a terrible idea for driving or staying on schedule. <strong>Vanilla OG Kush: </strong>Vanilla Kush brings out creamy vanilla flavors in this pure indica Kush. This strain induces a strong sense of relaxation, easing muscle tension, which appeals to many medical marijuana users. In smaller amounts, the mental effect is euphoric and thoughtful, yet relaxed. Heavy indulgence strengthens the effects, leading to a trippy and potentially sleepy tunnel vision that may cause couchlock or napping. <strong>Lemon Ice: </strong>Lemon Ice marijuana is a plant for the new age. Developed to be stronger and tastier than any other plant. The result is a very good smoke with exceptional high. Large, sticky buds look and smell amazing. You've got to try this bud, one of the finest marijuana strains in the world. <strong>Grape Kush #2 </strong>Growing plants have a strong odor, both sweet and musky.The harvest from this strain is connoisseur-grad ebud with a sweetish smoke. The high comes on very slowly, building up for as much as an hour, and then settles in for the night - a bit more like a pot brownie stone than the usual smoker's rush. traces of haze in the stone add inspiration to the conversation, and some radiant dreams or fantasies at bedtime. It's a relaxing and social effect, like red wine, and a good antidote to social anxiety. <strong> </strong> <strong></strong> <strong> </strong> <strong><em> </em></strong></p> <p></p>

32521:::Chronic Therapy Recreational:::<p></p> <p>In the beginning, there was no name, no storefront and no growers. Four friends began a conversation on where to get medical marijuana for a family member suffering from cancer. That was the beginning. We started growing out of a garage and as the rules and regulations grew so did our hopes and dreams of helping people with pain management. Using our savings, selling luxury items, maxing out credit cards and tightening our boot straps we made our dreams a reality, Chronic Therapy was born. Chronic Therapy was created in 2010 and has grown to a small, family run business where our number one goal is to help people with pain management and provide top quality MMJ at affordable prices. Chronic Therapy currently owns and operates a Medical Marijuana Dispensary and a State of the Art organic grow facility located in Wheat Ridge CO. On 5/19/14 Chronic Therapy opened its doors to recreational customers and is now serving everyone 21+.</p> <p></p>

Eating away at your liver and other organs, especially if you have other illnesses such as me like diabetes and high blood pressure. Then a friend told me about medical marijuana, I did my research and discovered that marijuana was good for my chronic pain and neuropathy in my legs due to my injury. For anyone who deals with chronic pain, you know that not only do you deal with physical pain you also deal with mental pain. Marijuana helps with my anxiety, depression and insomnia.</p>  <p>I wish that I had thought about medical marijuana a long time ago. It could have helped my mother who died from lung cancer several years ago with the pain she was having due to chemotherapy and radiation. My nephew did several tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and suffers from PTSD. He had been given numerous prescription medications which nothing worked until he tried medical marijuana.</p>  <p>Medical marijuana is believed to be good for over 200 ailments such as stuttering, insomnia, premenstrual syndrome, preventing nausea and vomiting in cancer patients, increasing appetite, relieving pain, preventing blindness from glaucoma, control epileptic seizures, stops cancer from spreading, decrease anxiety, slows progression of Alzheimer’s disease, relieves arthritis discomfort, and the list goes on and on.</p>  <p>Clouds of Serenity's vision is to provide cannabis based edibles and flowers to chronically ill or pained patients who have received a doctor’s prescription. We work directly with patients and service providers, such as doctor’s offices, clinics and hospice centers to deliver safe, reliable cannabis products.</p>  <p>Genesis 1:29</p>  <p>And God saith, ‘Lo, I have given to you every herb sowing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in which is the fruit of tree sowing seed, to you it is for food; Every herb bearing seed and tree bearing fruit is granted to man for his sustenance.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Clouds Of Serenity is a sister Corporation to Weedidit Association delivery service.

Satisfaction is guaranteed.</p>  <p>Our Passion for Plants: <br />Our team of nine growers cultivates more than 70 strains of medical cannabis, which we only sell in jars.

I need to say something, or I'll feel bad.</p>  <p>Guys, we as a collective DO NOT ENDORSE www.MedicalMarijuanaLoans.com. AT ALL. PERIOD. They have been leaving fake reviews from satisfied &quot;patients&quot; who mention that we referred them to this website. THIS IS A LIE.</p>  <p>Weedmaps' support team has been good about nuking these reviews, but there will always be a latency period. So, just in case. If you're feeling uneasy about their newest fake review, well, you should be. Triple C's would never refer you to quasi-legal loan sharks.</p>  <p>UPDATE 1/15/14: Since getting the new phone number; we've been having complaints about it working sometimes, not working other times. If you are having trouble reaching us by phone, please try our email and we will get back to you as soon as the technology allows us to :)</p>  <p>UPDATE 7/13/13: I take NO responsibility for the verbal bitchslapping that the next non-patient who calls trying to order will be subjected to. Are you interested in becoming a medical patient? Awesome! Feel free to call; and we can help you with that. Are you a 17 year old trying to slip through the cracks on a busy Friday night? Don't even try, you're just wasting time for both of us.</p>  <p>UPDATE 5/17/13: Triple C's is delighted to now offer credit card ordering!</p>  <p>Sick of &quot;local&quot; delivery services that inexplicably take hours to get you your medicine? Want quality medicine, compassionate service/pricing, and expedient delivery? Want them all rolled together? Then the Connoisseurs' Cannabis Collective is right for you.</p>  <p>Our prices on both top-shelf and budget medication are second to none.

The leaves of the cannabis plant also contain some cannabinoids, but in much lower concentration. The flowers and leaves of the plant can be smoked, vaporized, or used to prepare edibles. <strong>Cannabis Sativa</strong> Cannabis Sativa is a tall, slower growing and maturing plant that typically has long thin leaves that may vary in color from light green to darker green. Sativa buds are long and thin and turn red as they mature in a warm environment. In cooler environments the buds may be slightly purple. Sativa plants smell sweet and fruity and the smoke is generally quite mild. Cannabis sativa is a source of fiber for rope and other products. The cannabis sativa medicating effect is often characterized as uplifting and energetic. The effects of a cannabis sativa are mostly cerebral. They give a feeling of optimism and wellbeing, as well as providing a good measure of pain relief for certain symptoms. A few pure sativas are also very high in THC content. They are known to have a quite hallucinogenic effect. Sativas are a good choice for daytime medication. <strong>Cannabis Indica</strong> Cannabis indica is a short to moderate height bushy plant, generally between three and six feet, and its leaves have short broad fingers. The leaves are generally dark green, and are sometimes tinged with purple. As they near maturity, the leaves may turn more purple in color. Indica is a strong smelling plant. The smoke of indicas is generally thick and more prone to cause coughing when inhaled. Indicas are the traditional source of hashish. The cannabis indica medicating effect is most often described as a pleasant body buzz. Indicas are great for relaxation, stress relief, and for an overall sense of calm and serenity. Cannabis indicas are also very effective for overall body pain relief, and often used in the treatment of insomnia. They are the late evening choice of many patients as an all-night sleep aid. <strong>Hash</strong> Hash or hashish is manufactured by separating the trichomes from the cannabis flowers, to create a concentrated dose of this specific part of the cannabis plant. The trichomes are the glistening whitish specks that you see on dried cannabis flowers. The trichomes are then processed into a relatively solid paste or block. Hash can be somewhat powdery or more solid and sticky, depending on exactly how it was processed. Because of its elevated concentration, a much smaller quantity is necessary to receive the same effects as with the dry flowers. Hash can be smoked or vaporized by itself, generally a special attachment or device is necessary to use has with your vaporizing equipment. Check with your vaporizer manufacturer for more information. Has can also be used to make edibles It can also be sprinkled on top of cannabis before smoking or vaporizing to augment the trichome content in the flowers. </em></strong></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> <strong><em>Tourist Welcome</em></strong> <strong>The Depot Town Dispensary is dedicated to providing qualified patients access to scientifically tested medical-grade cannabis in a safe, convenient, and affordable manner, in an environment where all are treated with respect, compassion, and care.

FULLYS STORY Read how it all began and listen to my hearts plea. I have waded through the cloudy waters of this healing herb for as long as I have been an adult. After having my entire crop stolen from me, I was forced to rely on a delivery service to fulfill my alternative medicinal choice. Although, I was admittedly happy that I no longer had to go to an illegitimate source (where I was paying 90 bones for the bomb-diggity!) I was not happy with the size or quality. I want everyone that has taken the bold move of controlling what they put in their body as medicine to be saved the 3 years of wasting money, energy, and emotional distress.

As MM patients in the area, we recognized the challenge of finding quality medicine in the available markets. The closest dispensaries are in Sacramento and Vallejo but we found that the best bud was going straight to the higher-paying markets in SF and LA, making it difficult to find high quality, potent medicine in the available dispensaries. We started GHC, a collective of local growers and patients which delivers directly to the Vacaville market as well as surrounding areas (Davis, Woodland, Winters and Dixon) without the ability to easily access a brick and mortar dispensary. We bring a range of high quality indoor flowers, selected for their medicinal potency, and continue to develop medicinal products to meet the needs of our patients. And we never charge a delivery fee!</p>  <p>Check out Triple Beam, our in-house, top quality organic indoor.</p> <p></p>

Compassion for the patients. The best way we could help was make the meds affordable. We want to give patients the best meds at the lowest possible cost. So we provide the best meds cheaper than anyone. We put a lot of thought and effort in what would make a great collective. So we made the biggest showroom around. Huge counters displays with everything out for patients to see touch and smell. Over 40 different strains. We want to have a more personal experience with each and every patient and there individual needs. Never rushing anyone answering each and every question. Feel free to take as long as you need, looking at our huge selection making sure you get what you want, not what the bud tender is trying to push. We want all of are patients comfortable and happy. We are here for the patient not profit and that's why we are the cheapest in the state. If there is ever anything you feel we could do better please let us know, we are here for you.

Ask us about the qualifications of our delivery driver. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> <strong>About Green Ridge Green Ridge Organics</strong></p>  <p> <strong>Green Ridge Organics</strong> is a delivery service in Solano County. We were previously a group of friends who grew for each other and we were members of a small private collective. </p>  <p> Most delivery services and dispensaries purchase their medicine from &quot;vendors&quot;. Be cautious about this. Our growers are our original founding members. They are craftsmen (and craftswomen). All our grows are small, boutique, operations - so our growers have time to attend to each plant and take extra care in preparing medication. </p>  <p> If you have a real medical condition, we are your collective. If you appreciate straightforward talk, you'll like us. And if you are fussy about the quality of your medication, we are right there with you. We really listen to our members and we help them tailor solutions that optimize their health and happiness. We are careful about how we grow our medicine and what we offer to you, because we use it ourselves. </p>  <p> Our top-shelf is pure top-bud (not the popcorn buds from the bottom of the plant), and we allow our plants to mature completely. We find this allows better pain relief, energy and clarity of thought, without anxiety - even with strains that are famous for causing anxiety. Commercial &quot;vendors&quot; tend to harvest early, because every day is more cost and risk. We think this compromises the medical value.</p>  <p> Our corporate secretary and our CEO both operated USDA and FDA inspected food plants so they are fastidious about the cleanliness of our grows. This is important, since some of our members and friends have compromised immune systems. </p>  <p> Give us a shout. We will treat you right. <br /> <br /> This page is Intended for California residents, 21 years of age or older, with a valid California ID and a valid doctor's recommendation for Medical Marijuana. <br /> </p> <p></p>

SIMULTANEOUSLY. At Higher Approach we hold ourselves to a much higher standard of care than is typically found in the industry. Too often patients are forced to accept questionable product, inefficient practices, unprofessional employees, and a lackadaisical attitude towards timeliness with a grain of salt. We created Higher Approach to give patients an alternative to the madness. No longer will you have to blindly order your medicine based on its name or employee recommendation, because we have provided a detailed and up-to-date menu online @ www.higherapproach.com with pictures, descriptions, and lab test results for all of our medicine. **If you're still unsure, or don't want to go to our website, we have a sample of every strand in glass jar for you to look at, smell, feel, smoosh between your fingers, or however you like to examine your medicine.** For your convenience we have an OPTIONAL delivery booking system, so that our busyness won't affect your wait time. It requires less than a day's planning, and ensures that you always know when we're coming. Again, if you didn't book a delivery, no worries... we are always accepting call-ins and new patients. Our early morning and evening hours were chosen to cater to the busy professional, and it is our goal to provide the privacy, consistency, speed, and professionalism that their lifestyle demands. You will have the freedom to access us for verification or ordering 24-7 online, on your own schedule, not just during set business hours. In keeping with our high quality philosophy, Higher Approach has chosen to carry only top shelf medicine (flowers and concentrates) and edibles. <br />* WE ARE OPEN ALL HOLIDAYS <br />Higher Approach welcomes your plastic, whether it be VISA, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover.</p> <p></p>

Supercritcal extraction involves pressurizing and heating dry material along with liquid or gaseous CO2. The combination of heat and temperature turns the harmless carbon dioxide into a solvent, which extracts the active ingredients out of cannabis. The same process is used to extract caffeine from coffee (thats how we get decaf now!) and to extract flavoring, like vanilla extracts. When used with cannabis, the resulting oil is a safe, pure, potent, pest- and mold-resistant, easy-to-dose, and highly effective medicine with many applications. It is comparable to butane waxes in potency, but WITHOUT any risk of exposure to harmful butane or ethanol residue used to make many other waxes and oils.</p> <p></p>

Not HQD! Other delivery places that did seem decently priced would always have a minimum delivery charge, (usually like 80-100 dollars, which I cannot afford!) Not HQD! Some delivery places seemed decently priced, with no minimum delivery charge, BUT you literally have to wait until THE NEXT DAMN DAY for your order to go through and be delivered to your house (what's the point, you guys, seriously?) Not HQD! (The first time I had contacted them and started the verification process, they responded back with ETA 5 seconds...I was like are you kidding me? They are literally that fast, a huge plus!) Deaf Friendly Meter (out of 5) 6/5!! The fact that you can conduct business discreetly over text messaging is great for us deafies. Both guys are very easy to lipread and understand, and not to mention, super-friendly! Bud Quality is phenomenal. My FTP they hooked me up with some top-shelf I was not at all dissapointed! Been a while since I had a real strong OG flavor and taste in a bud lately. Real big and well trimmed nugs, tight and just a pleasure to smoke. Now enjoying my Saturday morning with some of their amazing Kobe OG they dropped off yesterday. I love their price ranges too, I have yet to try any edible or concentrate, but I know it'll be some danky fire for sure. :} Last but not least, the very fact that you do not have to: Hop into your car, deal with moronic LA traffic and drivers for around half an hour, fight to find parking (most dispensaries lately don't seem to have their own lots anymore...so sad that a bunch of good ones have shut down in Eagle Rock area w/ no explanation), walk through sometimes sketchy neighborhoods, fill out 10 page applications, and deal with people behind thick glass, etc...you get the idea...makes delivery all the much better! And High Quality Delivery delivers in spades! They are the top of the crop, you can't go wrong with these guys. And now it says they're open 24 hours? Good lord. A+++&quot; - Deafstoner <br /> <br />The FOrce is Finally With Us! - December 03, 2012 </p>  <p>&quot;Thanks HQD, The FTP deal was a great one.....Also The Yoda is Very Helpful in taking care of the pain, and is the right amount of potency (THC)!

With low prices, high grade medication, and free delivery 2 EVERYONE , Hollistic Essentials offers an easy way to get the medication you need. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> About Hollistic Essentials is a marijuana dispensary and delivery service. Modern research suggests that cannabis is a valuable aid in the treatment of a wide range of clinical applications. These include pain relief particularly of neuropathic pain (pain from nerve damage), nausea, spasticity, glaucoma, and movement disorders. Marijuana is also a powerful appetite stimulant, specifically for patients suffering from HIV, the AIDS wasting syndrome, or dementia. Emerging research suggests that marijuana's medicinal properties may protect the body against some types of malignant tumors and are neuroprotective. With all these benefits, and no medical problems (if used with a vaporizer or taken in edible form), who wouldn't want to use a drug as safe and effective as Marijuana for pain or other illnesses? For Holistic Essentials, providing great medical marijuana (edibles and raw plant) isn't enough. We go two steps further, we offer top of the line service, and also deliver our products, all for free. At Hollistic Essentials, everything is about the customer, we are a non-profit organization dedicated to helping you. We even offer a 5% <strong>discount</strong> for our veteran, senior citizen, and homebound patients. Just be sure to mention this when you call! </p> <p></p>

23670:::Maggie's Farm - Fillmore - Medical Only:::<p></p> <p>DON'T TRY THIS INDOORS KIDS! SUN-GROWN OUTDOORS IN 100% TRULY ORGANIC ALL-NATURAL SOIL, CUSTOM WATERED FROM A SPRING, SLOWLY CURED then HAND TRIMMED, THERE AIN'T NOTHIN LIKE THE REAL THING! As grower &amp; owner of Maggie's Farm, I feel fortunate for the opportunity to FINALLY share the results of a product grown under my native state's SUN and climate with the Medical Marijuana community. This is a different level of medicine of which you can FEEL. THANKS TO ALL PATIENTS WHO HAVE DARED TRY A DIFFERENT OUTDOOR PRODUCT, AND FOR SPREADING THE WORD AMONG THE COMMUNITY! FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAMPLE OUR MEDICINE, COME IN AND LET YOUR BODY TELL YOU WHAT IT LIKES!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Completely Different Energy</p>  <p>It always starts with a seed. That's Nature's preferred choice for reproduction...a seed. <br />Always has been. Maggie's Farm always grows from seed. <br />Cloned plants can develop &quot;genetic drift&quot; which deals with how traits begin to change as a plant gets weathered through stress. Cannabis is an annual, in nature, which is reborn every spring through seed germination.</p>  <p>Indoor growers, working with plants weathered by abnormal stress, IE: like never-dying mother plants, will use insecticides, hormones, stimulants, and fungicides to keep the mother plants &quot;healthy&quot;. The plant’s health is only temporary though as chemicals actually change the plant, leading to the &quot;genetic drift&quot;.</p>  <p>Growing from seed is simply better. Seed is a fresh genetic representation which has not been through &quot;seasons&quot; of abuse. </p>  <p>Carefully bred, seed grown plants, can exhibit something called &quot;genetic vigor,&quot; when plants actually excel beyond previous expectations. We work to ensure that we don't weaken genetics through inbreeding. We focus on reproducing your favorite genetics, while we also help grow the science of cannabis genetics, in cooperation with the industries leading professionals. </p>  <p>For gigantic, industrial, indoor, grows, cloning is a mandatory part of manufacturing <br />on a very fast tight schedule, rushing out 6 super sized crops each year. <br />Large factories that must clone, carry a very different intention and energy, <br /> than outdoor farms in the country do.</p>  <p>All in an attempt to recreate elements that Nature already had dialed in, and perfected eons ago. Maggie's Farm grows outdoors, only one crop each year.

Each grower has given us a VERY limited supply for our members to sample. When we find a great strain/grower we do our best to make that a regular on our menu. <strong>ALL OF THESE STRAINS ARE FIRE!</strong> So, if you are lucky enough to try one of these experimental strains, we are asking you to give us a review so we can better know the quality of each grower/strain. <strong>OUR GOAL:</strong> To bring you ONLY the very best grown medicine, grown by the VERY best growers at the very best prices and as quickly as possible. <strong>REVIEW: </strong>I have smoked a few of these strains so far because I wanted to have a better idea of how each of them worked. ALL I can say is WOW... I love my job! I woke up this morning and smoked some 3 KINGS and boy did it slow me down. Next up I smoked Peacemaker and if you pick this one up be sure you have some where comfortable to kick it for a while. I could literally feel the high tugging me down from the back of my head and strait onto my butt. I also smoked some Alaskan Thunderfuck last night and if you like an upper that one has a very uplifting effect, which I found to be very enjoyable. ALSO I thought it smoked like Christmas... If that makes any scene. <strong>UPDATE:</strong> Mary Jane is currently rejecting 8 out of every 10 strains presented to us by our growers. Of these 20% of strains that have made our cut, you the members, have so far only rejected one offering. Although we wish we could get it right every time we are proud of the strains we carry and know the quality will speak for itself. ______________________________________ <strong>QUALITY &amp; ACCURACY GUARANTEED </strong> <strong>Quality Guaranteed: </strong>Mary Jane stands behind the flowers she has on her menu 100%. If the medication you receive does not meet your needs you MUST contact us within 24 hours so we can exchange out your remaining medication for something more suitable. It's that easy...

(1/3 non-refundable deposit required.) ______________________________________ <strong>NEW STRAINS</strong> Mary Jane's Medicine Shop is experimenting with new growers so we bring in 2-4 new strains every week. Each grower has given us a VERY limited supply for our members to sample. When we find a great strain/grower we do our best to make that a regular on our menu. <strong>ALL OF THESE STRAINS ARE FIRE!</strong> So, if you are lucky enough to try one of these experimental strains, we are asking you to give us a review so we can better know the quality of each grower/strain. <strong>OUR GOAL:</strong> To bring you ONLY the very best grown medicine, grown by the VERY best growers at the very best prices and as quickly as possible. <strong>REVIEW: </strong>I have smoked a few of these strains so far because I wanted to have a better idea of how each of them worked. ALL I can say is WOW... I love my job! I woke up this morning and smoked some 3 KINGS and boy did it slow me down. Next up I smoked Peacemaker and if you pick this one up be sure you have some where comfortable to kick it for a while. I could literally feel the high tugging me down from the back of my head and strait onto my butt. I also smoked some Alaskan Thunderfuck last night and if you like an upper that one has a very uplifting effect, which I found to be very enjoyable. ALSO I thought it smoked like Christmas... If that makes any scene. <strong>UPDATE:</strong> Mary Jane is currently rejecting 8 out of every 10 strains presented to us by our growers. Of these 20% of strains that have made our cut, you the members, have so far only rejected one offering. Although we wish we could get it right every time we are proud of the strains we carry and know the quality will speak for itself. ______________________________________ <strong>QUALITY &amp; ACCURACY GUARANTEED </strong> <strong>Quality Guaranteed: </strong>Mary Jane stands behind the flowers she has on her menu 100%. If the medication you receive does not meet your needs you MUST contact us within 24 hours so we can exchange out your remaining medication for something more suitable. It's that easy... We know sometimes the medication is to STRONG or to WEAK for your needs and it's our job to make sure you get what you NEED. <strong>Accuracy Guaranteed:</strong> Mary Jane stands behind the accuracy of all flowers and concentrates which have been weighed to your door with our <strong>DOUBLE THE DIFFERENCE GUARANTEE</strong>. If you medication you ordered is under amount you donated for Mary Jane will immediately <strong>DOUBLE THE DIFFERENCE</strong> for her error. HOWEVER to dispute the accuracy of our measurements you MUST weigh out the amount your ordered at the time of the delivery and in front of the driver. (The driver carries a scale if you do not have one.) Its that easy... We <strong>DOUBLE THE DIFFERENCE</strong> if we make a mistake but you MUST be sure to weigh it out in front of the driver before he goes. ______________________________________ <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> The pictures of our medication have been taken by us and not just ripped from the internet.

We are always accepting applications from prospective members so please contact us if you are interested in joining the collective. We ask for a 100 dollar minimum donation on all orders because we take the time to allow our patients to sample the medicine before they donate. Also, our consultants offer to bring a broad selection of products and flowers for our patients to choose from. In addition, we ask our growers to grow the kinds of Cannabis that our patients prefer and also take the time to understand every one of our patient's needs. Lastly, we offer free medicine to a few of our patients with severe health problems and limited income. Ultimately, our goal is to help guide people with chronic health conditions in obtaining access to consistent, affordable, and high-grade medicine that really works for their given condition. For now, we are no longer accepting new patients in Isla Vista or under 21 years of age unless they are seriously in need of Medical Marijuana for Medical purposes.

14673:::NHCD / East Bay:::<p></p> <p>Natural Healing Connection Delivery is a Non-Profit, 100% compliant delivery only service. Our mission, is to try to provide a delivery service that is known for being compassionate and fair, without losing the quality. As many of us struggle to just make ends meet, there is already enough stress and anxiety without having to worry about how you are going to be able to get your medicine. We understand that there are many services to choose from, most of them provide a great service. We just want to be part of those that truly care about you and are providing this very essential and necessary service for all the right reasons. By now, you probably have read our menu and noticed our donation amounts. We already know what you are thinking, &quot;this medicine must not be very good&quot;, well, as we like to say, &quot;Don't judge a Bud by its number&quot;! That's it, that's all we got. We're not going to try and convince you that we're the &quot;best&quot;, or provide the &quot;best&quot; medicine. In all honesty, we're not so sure that anyone can say for sure which is the &quot;best&quot;, there's just too many to try. What we will do, is guarantee you that we will ALWAYS try to provide the highest quality medicine we can, for a reasonable and fair donation. We will listen to you, give you the best information we can and most of all, really and truly care. We guarantee these things, only because they are things that we at NHCD can control. We will never promise or guarantee anything that we cannot completely control, such as, traffic, road work, etc. There are times that we get quite busy and the delivery time may be up to 2-3 hours from the time you order. We make it a habit to keep in contact so that you know how much longer it will be, and we will NEVER not show up. To be able to provide you with a higher quality medicine for a fair donation, this is one of those things where we all have to try and work together and really just be understanding. If you are in immediate need, place your order early to be sure you receive it when you would like. You may also request a specific time you would like your delivery, if that specific time is open and our driver is not already across town, we would be happy to deliver at the specified time. <strong><strong>All patients must be Pre-Verified by providing the following:</strong> <strong>California Drivers License</strong> <strong>Original Recommendation with stamp and doctor signature</strong> <strong>Patients must also provide these at time of visit</strong> <strong>NO EXCEPTIONS!!</strong> <strong>By contacting us, you agree and acknowledge the following:</strong> <strong>You are over 18 years of age.</strong> <strong>You have a *current* Medical Marijuana recommendation from a licensed physician in the state of California.</strong> <strong>You are not a law enforcement officer, nor a postal inspector, or operating under an assumed name or in cooperation with any criminal investigation, nor are you seeking out evidence which may serve as a basis for any charge of violating, federal, state, or local laws.</strong> <strong>You have read and understand Proposition 215, SB420 and the laws pertaining to your rights and limitations as a medical marijuana patient.</strong> <strong><em></em></strong><strong><em>This is a legal advertisement for Medicinal Marijuana in compliance with California H&amp;S 11362.5, Prop 215 &amp; CA SB 420.

Nurturing In Cannabis Extracts - N.I.C.E. wellness. Delivery requires minimum $40.00 donation. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>At N.I.C.E. Wellness, Inc. our goal is to provide safe access/delivery to our patient(s)/member(s). We understand the importance in mother natures alternative medicine and its ability to help a wide range of ailments, an with research that list continues to grow. We have witnessed, first-hand from MMJ patients that suffer from cancer, damaged vertebra, head (brain) injuries, depression, insomnia, the list goes on and on….how medicinal cannabis has improved the persons overall well being an quality of life. Knowing many others suffer from such ailments and are in search of alternative treatment(s), medicine(s) and remedies, N.I.C.E. Wellness, Inc. collective was formed. </p>  <p>Some Research Information: <br />Modern research suggests that cannabis is a valuable aid in the treatment of a wide range of clinical applications. These include pain relief -- particularly of neuropathic pain (pain from nerve damage) -- nausea, spasticity, glaucoma, and movement disorders. Marijuana is also a powerful appetite stimulant, specifically for patients suffering from HIV, the AIDS wasting syndrome, or dementia. Emerging research suggests that marijuana's medicinal properties may protect the body against some types of malignant tumors and are neuro-protective.</p>  <p>Cannabinoids have a remarkable safety record, particularly when compared to other therapeutically active substances. Most significantly, the consumption of marijuana -- regardless of quantity or potency -- cannot induce a fatal overdose. According to a 1995 review prepared for the World Health Organization, &quot;There are no recorded cases of overdose fatalities attributed to cannabis, and the estimated lethal dose for humans extrapolated from animal studies is so high that it cannot be achieved by ... users.&quot; As with any medication, patients should consult thoroughly with their physician before deciding whether the medical use of cannabis is safe and appropriate</p>  <p>N.I.C.E. Wellness, Inc. was formed adhering to California Proposition 215, the California Compassionate Use Act, which was enacted by the voters and took effect on Nov. 6, 1996 as California Health &amp; Safety Code 11362.5. The law makes it legal for patients and their designated primary caregivers to possess and cultivate marijuana for their personal medical use given the recommendation or approval of a California-licensed physician. </p>  <p>And</p>  <p>SB 420, a legislative statute, went into effect on January 1, 2004 as California H&amp;SC 11362.7-.83. This law broadens Prop. 215 to transportation and other offenses in certain circumstances; allows patients to form medical cultivation “collectives” or “cooperatives”; and establishes a voluntary state ID card system run through county health departments. SB 420 also establishes guidelines or limits as to how much patients can possess and cultivate. Legal patients who stay within the guidelines are supposed to be protected from arrest. </p>  <p>We Thank You an Have a NICE Day,</p>  <p>N.I.C.E.

Natural Alternatives only works with LOCAL (SW Washington) growers who take the time and money to cultivate quality medicine, concentrates, topicals and edibles for our patients and collective members in Clark County. Natural Alternatives' growers have cumulatively more than 100 years of experience producing the highest level medicine. They are very learned in the process and know their strains, resulting in varietals that have the desired affects. Our medicines are available ONLY for delivery.

Please make sure that you have both your ID and a valid Washington Medical Marijuana recommendation in hand and ready for presentation when the delivery person arrives. How the Natural Alternatives delivery system works: You must be a valid Washington Medical Marijuana patient with a legitimate ID. That will be verified immediately. You, the patient, will then decide what strain, concentrate, topical or edible you like from the Natural Alternatives' menu and how much you would like to reimburse. We have a $40 minimum donation and are happy to deliver to the Clark County area. We will not help people who are using medication for reasons other than that allowed by RCW 69.51A.

This is a legal advertisement for Medicinal Marijuana in compliance with California H&amp;S 11362.5, Prop 215 &amp; CA SB 420. Any donations requested are ONLY compensation for time, nutrients, electricity costs and other factors involved in the process of producing and delivering medical grade marijuana and not toward the sale or purchase of the medicine itself. <strong>NATURES BEST COLLECTIVE'S COMMON QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:</strong> <strong>Question</strong>: I have never used a delivery service before. How does it work? <strong>Answe</strong>r: To become a patient member of Natures Best Collective just give us a call at (619) 252-4620. We will verify that you are a new patient and send one of our drivers to you. Your first visit is just like going to a brick and mortar dispensary in that you need to have your Original Recommendation (the paper not the card) for medicinal cannabis and a valid California ID or Driver License.Our driver will scan those two items for our records. Then you must fill out the Member Agreements and sign the Rules and Regulations. <strong>Question</strong>: I am hesitant to place an order without being able to see the medicine because I don't want to get stuck with inferior medicine. Is it possible for me to inspect the medicine prior to making a donation? <strong>Answer</strong>: Natures Best Collective never make our patients pre-order their medicinal cannabis sight unseen. We show up to you with various strains of medicinal cannabis and you can make your decision by inspecting them, just like you do in a brick and mortar dispensary. If you don't like any of the medicine we have with us you are under no obligation to make a donation. Think of us as a dispensary that is located in your living room or a parking lot near you. <strong>Question</strong>: I am a little uncomfortable about having a delivery because I have snoopy neighbors and I also don't like having strangers in my home. Will the driver show up in a red, gold and green car with marijuana flags and Seedless clothing head to toe or will he be more discreet? <strong>Answer</strong>: Natures Best Collective prides ourselves on being as discreet as possible. All our drivers are Certified Cannabis Technicians and have undergone a criminal background check. We drive regular unmarked cars and we show up to your door with pizza type delivery bags so your snoopy neighbors will just think you are getting a pizza. Please email, call or text message us with any other questions you may have. </p> <p></p>

9645:::PATS Legacy - Mota-Bike Deliveries- South Orange County - FREE DELIVERY!:::<p></p> <p>The Story of PATS Legacy <br />And that which drives us… <br /> <br /> <br /> What is in a name? Is a rose by any other name not as sweet in smell and beauty? While all this may be true, is it not equally important for a name to inspire? Truly it can be. <br /> <br />PATS Legacy is a Medical Marijuana delivery service founded by me, John Whinnery in honor of my late Brother Pat. In order to know what inspires us, you must first know Pat’s story, and the code of honor and compassion that defined his life and career. This is his and our story. <br /> <br />My brother, William Patrick Whinnery (Pat), was born on March 21st, 1962 in Sandusky, Ohio. He was a bright child who loved sports, especially baseball. Our biological father was not around much when we were little and Pat was not only my older brother, he was also my mentor in both his life and death. I can still remember the many times when I cried in Pat’s arms as he comforted me and showered me with his love and compassion. And it was this very same compassion that would serve him well throughout his life. He never yelled, or lied to me. Instead he instilled in me good values, and taught me how to grow with compassion and love. <br /> <br />Although we grew up happy, Pat always knew he needed to leave our small town in order to truly grow. Small towns often have a way of inspiring good values to those who need to spread their wings. So when he graduated from High School he enlisted into the US Navy. This is where he found his passion in the medical field. After four years in the military he was hired by a prominent hospital in Southern California, and with that Pat found himself in Poway CA, where he started his family, and lived for over 17 years as a pharmacist. He truly loved his job, and mission in life. <br /> <br />Life was good for Pat and his family. He was active as a father, mentor and role model to his community. He was involved as a softball coach for several years and was a great teacher. No matter what the scenario, he always showed great strength and the ability to have compassion for others. His inspirational phrases were catchy and stuck with you; “Right Here, Right Now!” and “If you believe, you will achieve!” still ring in my ears and heart to this day. <br /> <br />At the hospital where he worked, he dealt with the outpatient treatment of children. Pat was a strong advocate and a great supporter of his patients, making deliveries at all hours of the night. He encouraged them daily to never give up and keep on fighting. But it didn’t stop there. Pat worked with the hospital to make it more affordable for those that were homebound with a low income to receive the treatments and medication they needed. He was a strong negotiator with the pharmaceutical companies and saved millions of dollars for both his patients and employer. Pat believed in the “Win/Win” scenario, and as a sign of respect and admiration for his hard work, the hospital established a yearly award to honor his life’s work. <br /> <br />In August of 2008, Pat got sick with pneumonia and was hospitalized. While there, he was diagnosed with Single Cell Lung Cancer (stage 4). Being the fighter that he was, Pat immediately started the chemo and radiation treatments that were prescribed by his doctors and colleagues. He knew all to well what he was up against. As a result, he put his body through months of suffering and side effects from the prescribed treatments. Headaches, nausea, lack of sleep, cold chills, loss of appetite, loss of weight, loss of taste, loss of hair, and forgetfulness plagued him throughout the process. Yet, he never gave up, and never once missed a single day of work during the first six months of his treatments. <br /> <br />Soon, it got to the point where Pat was struggling so hard with the debilitating side effects of the chemo and radiation treatments that he decided to reach out to an alternative treatment doctor. The doctor recommended medical marijuana to help relieve the debilitating side effects of his treatments. Almost instantly, medical marijuana provided relief from his suffering, and his battle continued. <br /> <br />Ultimately the cancer got the best of him, and on June 8th, 2009, Pat left us for a better place. This is why I have come up with idea to carry on Pat’s legacy in the creation of PATS (Passionate Alternative Treatment Services) Legacy, a compassionate delivery service for Medical Marijuana for those that need it most. PATS Legacy is dedicated to providing the highest quality medicine to our members on a consistent basis, in an effort to assist them in their day-to-day battle with the debilitating side effects of cancer treatments and other ailments. <br /> <br />But Pat’s story is not unique. Nor is his lesson limited to that of comfort and compassion. Pats’ real lesson to us all is in how he lived his life! <br /> <br />I recently read of a man who stood to speak at the funeral of a family member and friend. He referred to the dates on the tombstone from the beginning to the end. He pointed out that most people see only first the date of birth and then the date of the death. While what mattered most of all was the “dash” between those years. It is the “dash” that represents all the time that was spent alive on earth. And once gone, only those that loved them can know what that little “dash” line is truly worth.

9645:::Pats Legacy Delivery Service:::<p></p> <p>The Story of PATS Legacy <br />And that which drives us… <br /> <br /> <br />What is in a name? Is a rose by any other name not as sweet in smell and beauty? While all this may be true, is it not equally important for a name to inspire? Truly it can be. <br /> <br />PATS Legacy is a Medical Marijuana delivery service founded by me, John Whinnery in honor of my late Brother Pat. In order to know what inspires us, you must first know Pat’s story, and the code of honor and compassion that defined his life and career. This is his and our story. <br /> <br />My brother, William Patrick Whinnery (Pat), was born on March 21st, 1962 in Sandusky, Ohio. He was a bright child who loved sports, especially baseball. Our biological father was not around much when we were little and Pat was not only my older brother, he was also my mentor in both his life and death. I can still remember the many times when I cried in Pat’s arms as he comforted me and showered me with his love and compassion. And it was this very same compassion that would serve him well throughout his life. He never yelled, or lied to me. Instead he instilled in me good values, and taught me how to grow with compassion and love. <br /> <br />Although we grew up happy, Pat always knew he needed to leave our small town in order to truly grow. Small towns often have a way of inspiring good values to those who need to spread their wings. So when he graduated from High School he enlisted into the US Navy. This is where he found his passion in the medical field. After four years in the military he was hired by a prominent hospital in Southern California, and with that Pat found himself in Poway CA, where he started his family, and lived for over 17 years as a pharmacist. He truly loved his job, and mission in life. <br /> <br />Life was good for Pat and his family. He was active as a father, mentor and role model to his community. He was involved as a softball coach for several years and was a great teacher. No matter what the scenario, he always showed great strength and the ability to have compassion for others. His inspirational phrases were catchy and stuck with you; “Right Here, Right Now!” and “If you believe, you will achieve!” still ring in my ears and heart to this day. <br /> <br />At the hospital where he worked, he dealt with the outpatient treatment of children. Pat was a strong advocate and a great supporter of his patients, making deliveries at all hours of the night. He encouraged them daily to never give up and keep on fighting. But it didn’t stop there. Pat worked with the hospital to make it more affordable for those that were homebound with a low income to receive the treatments and medication they needed. He was a strong negotiator with the pharmaceutical companies and saved millions of dollars for both his patients and employer. Pat believed in the “Win/Win” scenario, and as a sign of respect and admiration for his hard work, the hospital established a yearly award to honor his life’s work. <br /> <br />In August of 2008, Pat got sick with pneumonia and was hospitalized. While there, he was diagnosed with Single Cell Lung Cancer (stage 4). Being the fighter that he was, Pat immediately started the chemo and radiation treatments that were prescribed by his doctors and colleagues. He knew all to well what he was up against. As a result, he put his body through months of suffering and side effects from the prescribed treatments. Headaches, nausea, lack of sleep, cold chills, loss of appetite, loss of weight, loss of taste, loss of hair, and forgetfulness plagued him throughout the process. Yet, he never gave up, and never once missed a single day of work during the first six months of his treatments. <br /> <br />Soon, it got to the point where Pat was struggling so hard with the debilitating side effects of the chemo and radiation treatments that he decided to reach out to an alternative treatment doctor. The doctor recommended medical marijuana to help relieve the debilitating side effects of his treatments. Almost instantly, medical marijuana provided relief from his suffering, and his battle continued. <br /> <br />Ultimately the cancer got the best of him, and on June 8th, 2009, Pat left us for a better place. This is why I have come up with idea to carry on Pat’s legacy in the creation of PATS (Passionate Alternative Treatment Services) Legacy, a compassionate delivery service for Medical Marijuana for those that need it most. PATS Legacy is dedicated to providing the highest quality medicine to our members on a consistent basis, in an effort to assist them in their day-to-day battle with the debilitating side effects of cancer treatments and other ailments. <br /> <br />But Pat’s story is not unique. Nor is his lesson limited to that of comfort and compassion. Pats’ real lesson to us all is in how he lived his life! <br /> <br />I recently read of a man who stood to speak at the funeral of a family member and friend. He referred to the dates on the tombstone from the beginning to the end. He pointed out that most people see only first the date of birth and then the date of the death. While what mattered most of all was the “dash” between those years. It is the “dash” that represents all the time that was spent alive on earth. And once gone, only those that loved them can know what that little “dash” line is truly worth. For it matters not how much we own, but how we lived and loved, and how we spent our “dash”. <br /> <br />Pat’s true lesson to us all can be found in his “dash”. His “dash” was his gift. And it is “this gift” that drives my passion and quest to help the people who need it most. For with this quest…“I am my Brother’s keeper.” <br /> <br />GOD BLESS AND MAY PEACE BE WITH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY!!! </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> PATS Legacy: Orange County's Top Quality Medical Marijuana Delivery Service.

We love to hear your feedback and will go out of our way to carry products that our customers really want.

Our entire team is committed to meeting those needs and providing the highest quality medication and services to our members. We want to make sure that every time you walk through our doors you receive quality service and products. As a result, a high percentage of our membership is due to referrals. Patient safety is of the utmost concern. 70% of the medication that we offer is 100% organic. We understand that not everyone prefers all organically grown products and we aim to provide a variety of choices for each patient. </p> <p></p>

16685:::Rip City Remedies:::<p></p> <p> Rip City Remedies offers the largest selection of Oregon Grown Organic Medicine. We are a nonprofit Oregon Medical Marijuana Program (OMMP) Cannabis Club for patients, growers and caregivers collectively dedicated to making medical cannabis more accessible for card holding patients. We follow all guidelines set forth by ORS 475.300-475.46. We help provide easily accessible medication for patients in need. We are wheelchair accessible, with a side parking lot and neighborhood parking. We offer multiple services for patients suffering from debilitating conditions such as severe pain, severe nausea, persistent muscle spasms, seizures, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, glaucoma, HIV, cachexia, epilespsy, GERD, IBS, multiple sclerosis and more. We also have available edible medicated foods of all sorts, hash, oils, salves, creams, tinctures and cannabutter. We offer the widest local selection of organically grown variety of flowers, and have pest and disease free clones of many strains available upon request. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>1. Who is your service for? <br />A: Our services are for up-to date and valid OMMP patients, their caregivers and growers with proof of ID. </p>  <p>2. Is your service legal, how is it legal? <br />A: Under state law and LEAP programs, OMMP is tolerated, but under federal law, the sale/purchase/possession of Marijuana is not legal. For more information read the PDF at: http://public.health.oregon.gov/DiseasesConditions/ChronicDisease/ MedicalMarijuanaProgram/Pages/475a.aspx and clicking &quot;ORS 475.300 - 475.346 (pdf)&quot;. We recommend all patients and participants of our service know the law for your protection and ours. <br />3. How do I get my OMMP card? <br />A: Go to a local, alternative medical clinic or another provider with your chart notes (records) for the last 3 doctors' visits for your condition (which includes but is not limited to; Chronic Severe Pain, Chronic Nausea, Chronic Muscle Spasms, Glaucoma, Cancer, AIDS/HIV, Arthritis, Asthma, Hepatitis C, Cachexia, Crohn's disease, GERD, IBS, Multiple Sclerosis, ALS, Neuropathy, Seizure Disorders, Parkinson's disease), and they will guide you. <br />4. Why is Rip City Remedies the spot for me? <br />A: We are completely within the law and are advised and backed by some of the leading Oregon Medical Marijuana Program lawyers. We also protect you and ourselves by being strict about wording and lingo used on our ads and during our interactions with you. We know the law and we make sure we are always within it. We also provide medically lab tested flowers, that are always organically grown for quality and safety for the health our patients. Non-organic and pesticide use can be harmful and counteract the medical qualities of marijuana products. </p>  <p>5. Can I buy meds? <br />THERE IS NO BUYING OR SELLING OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA ALLOWED IN THE STATE OF OREGON AT THIS TIME! <br />A: As the law currently stands, no one may purchase or sell marijuana in Oregon and still be protected by OMMP law. The grower may be reimbursed by a patient for costs associated with growing, but not for time or effort. We will correct anyone that uses any terms referencing sales/buying of Medical Marijuana and refuse service to anyone that does not follow our simple rules. <br />6. Can I donate meds? <br />A: Yes, if you are a grower/patient that grows your own meds for you or your patient, and they have signed contracts allowing your to disperse the excess meeds to help others who cannot produce their own. We prefer to work on a reimbursement basis. </p>  <p>7. If I already have a grower can I still use your service? <br />A: Yes, our service is perfect for those that already have a grower but haven't gotten meds yet. Our service does not interfere with your current arrangements for meds and is only an additional option for receiving the help you need. </p>  <p>8. If I am not an OMMP patient or am part of an out of state medical marijuana program, may I use your service? <br />A: Unfortunately for your protection and ours our service is only available to valid card holding OMMP patients that are Oregon residents with proof of ID. </p>  <p>9. What is the minimum and maximum amount of meds I can be donated or reimburse for through your service? <br />A: We have no minimun and a maximum of 28 grams (under 1 ounce) for first time patients. Trusted patients will then be able to be given the max amount we can provide at that time, and the maximum that OMMP law allows. </p>  <p>10. I'm too sick to meet people; can someone get my meds for me? <br />A: Our service is only for valid OMMP patients, but we offer our service to valid OMMP caregivers that have their card for those patients too sick or unable to get meds, they must have their Caregivers card and valid Oregon ID. </p>  <p>11. Can you give me clones/cuts/starts, and/or can I reimburse you for them? <br />A: Yes, for patients that need help getting started growing their own, we can get pest and disease free clones upon request. </p>  <p>12. Will you grow my meds for me? <br />A: At this time we have the maximum amount of cards you can have per grower, but we will potentially offer this as a service in the future for those that can't grow their own meds and are willing to sign a contract. </p>  <p>13. Do I get added to a list, do you keep records, and what do you do to protect my confidentiality? <br />A: No we do not keep a record of your information on file, however, we do check your OMMP ID and regular ID every time you come in. </p> <p></p>

12190:::SCMN: Repeat Winner High Times 1st Place Sativa!:::<p></p> <p>Home of the 1st Place High Times Cannabis Cup Winner for Best Sativa &quot;Cracker Jack&quot; 2 years in a row, and mentioned on the Howard Stern Show! Clean and Professional, SCMN offers a large selection of Clean Green Certified and Lab Tested Flowers, Delicious Edibles, Potent Concentrates and Powerful Tinctures! We offer Daily Deals and Discounts, Fun, Friendly and Educated Staff, Relaxed but Professional Atmosphere, Great Music and Great Vibes! Santa Cruz Mountain Naturals is an active and founding member of the Association for Standardized Cannabis based here in Santa Cruz County.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Santa Cruz Mountain Naturals is the First and Only Clean Green Certified collective in Santa Cruz County, and the first in the nation to be entirely lab tested for not only potency, but for absolute quality and safety assurance in our flowers. Our AAA Grade, biologically and naturally grown medical cannabis flowers, tinctures, concentrates and edibles are undoubtedly among the finest in Santa Cruz County, and according to the judges at the High Times Cannabis Cup, one of our strains was voted the Best Sativa in California, two years in a row! Our goal is to provide patients with a wide selection of Grade AAA medical cannabis and related products while using Clean Green, a third party organics certification to ensure that the medicine we are providing was cultivated, processed and handled at the minimum standards set by the USDA requirements for Organics. Our secondary focus is to provide educational services, volunteer programs, and encourage sustainability and environmental awareness. All of our flowers are grown in soil, using only natural products to ensure that your flowers are not only clean and safe, but maintain the highest quality aromas, flavors, and potency imaginable. We carry a large selection of indoor-grown flowers, but we only work with vendors who use natural and biological cultivation methods, not conventional hydroponics. Although we try to keep our prices under $50 an eighth, we believe that quality should demand an appropriate price. We believe that price-capping directs growers towards high yieldsrather than high quality. As the USDA will not certify Organic Medical Marijuana, Clean Green has become the standard. Ask for proof the next time anyone claims that their medicine is &quot;Organic&quot;. Santa Cruz Mountain Naturals also provides Massage Services for free on a first come first serve basis on Fridays to all of our members. Our packaging is Bio-degradable and compostable!

We prove our commitment to the industry with Better Business Bureau A+ rating, as a supporting member of both the National and California Cannabis Industry Association, with NORML membership, and as a Clean Green Certified Cultivatior and Processor/Handler.</p>  <p>Our commitment to our members goes beyond the industry and assures that our interactions with community and government are to the positive benefit of medical Cannabis users like you. Whether it is accepting and paying, federal, state, and sales tax in accordance with California law, paying disability and Social Security taxes instead of for-profit based &quot;commission&quot;, or providing health care to our employees, Ethnobotanica provides an example to the public and government that is unarguably proper in principle and conduct. As a medical marijuana patient, it is important to support organizations who defend and advance your right to use medical Cannabis in accordance with the law. We are committed to being that organization.</p>  <p>To find out more about Ethnobotanica, our products, and services, including our Compassionate Discount Program, beautiful pictures of our flowers, concentrates, and edibles, please visit our website.</p>  <p>PotDeli.org </p> <p></p>

7456:::SPARC SF:::<p></p> <p> SPARC is a nonprofit collective dedicated to providing, affordable, high quality cannabis and subsidized health services to our members. We aim to educate our patients about cannabis treatments and other alternative health approaches to supplement their medicine. SPARC advocates for government change. We seek to be a voice for the implementation of best practices for the regulation and taxation of medical cannabis. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> Serving patients since 2001 SPARC began as a collaboration between several small collectives serving distinct patient populations in San Francisco. SPARC's work was focused primarily on serving low-income patients suffering from chronic and terminal illnesses. As our member-base continued to expand through the integration of small patient collectives, we sought a permit from the City of San Francisco to open a central healing center and dispensary. This important step allows us to increase our capacity to serve a wider array of members. Our organization is rooted in the same compassionate, patient-centered service that we have maintained for almost a decade. We work to bring a community-friendly and scientific approach to providing medical cannabis to our members. Your membership with SPARC helps us continue to expand our free health service programs, as well as our subsidized distribution network for seriously ill, low-income patients in San Francisco. We have been providing medical cannabis to critically ill patients in hospice at no cost for almost 10 years. <em><strong>&quot;We are grateful for SPARC's partnership and support. We have seen many patients whose conditions have greatly improved through the use of cannabis for pain management, nausea, harm reduction and other valuable medical uses.&quot; Tim Patriarca, Former Executive Director of Maitri AIDS Hospice</strong></em> As a not for profit organization, our proceeds are reinvested directly into patient services and community activism. As we grow, our advocacy and patient services grow, too </p> <p></p>

Backed by a small group of patient/growers that provide clean top shelf medical grade cannabis to other patients of our collective, all donations accepted by San Joaquin Valley Wellness is invested into these collective patient gardens to provide a consistent supply of there specific grade of medical cannabis, call and join San Joaquin Valley Wellness today and &quot;Continue to grow with us!&quot;</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>San Joaquin Valley Wellness strives to carry not just the highest quality cannabis but the cleanest and healthiest medical grade cannabis, we believe are patient growers have accomplished this with a method of growing called &quot;veganic&quot; which is organic growing without the use of animal byproducts such as guanos (various animal feces),bone meal, and blood meal offend used in organic growing. This method of growing insures a complete control of plants during their life cycle allowing grower to have the ability to give plants what they need and flush them out just as quickly, insuring properly flush cannabis. No heavy metals (ex. arsenic), no heavy sediment (build up of organic matter or chemical salts), and NEVER any bud stacking chemicals used. We list descriptions of all menu items but these are meant to be used as a good overview of what the majority of patients experience but every patient is truly different and can experience completely different effects than the majority, that's why we suggest patients take advantage of our mix and match strain deals and try different strains at first to see what best suits their needs. We do not list aroma or taste in description although we insure the finest quality for both but because cannabis is still at perfect curing condition when it is pre bottled it keeps curing as long as seal is not broken, we have seen strains change drastically in aroma and taste after as little as a few days of curing and for this reason we do not list aroma and taste, but we can promise you every strain will be the smoothest cannabis possible and beautiful in all its ways. Drivers carry a sample kit of all of our menu items so that patients can see and smell medatication before purchasing. All 1/8ths are 4 grams, all meds are pre bottled grams and sealed for your protection, all quantity deals are mix and match any strain for the quantity deal price. Tax is included in menu price. Free delivery with minimum donation of $50</p> <p></p>

Come celebrate the end of marijuana prohibition in a place of history!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Here is the history part... The building was first open as the Mint Saloon back in 1835, then in 1896 it was purchased by Aldoph Coors himself. Records say that Coors beer was dispensed here until 1915. It turned into the Empire Shop where goods were sold by a Fran Richards. Later it had turned into an antique shop, which moved across the street, and now open to the public as a merchant of other fine goods. :) With a population of about 420, and an elevation of 8601', we are always high here in Empire. We welcome all and all questions. Thanks for coming!</p> <p></p>

Warm, welcome and honest, we want to improve our patrons quality of life! </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>We do not solicit reviews on Weedmaps, nor do we self aggrandize by reviewing ourselves. All the reviews that you see here are people who have taken the time to voice their opinions about how we're doing and we are very grateful for their feedback. Our regulars know where to get the love and we do love up on our regulars. </p>  <p>We also love when patients don't need us anymore. What!? Yes, you read it right. Some of our regulars no longer see us anymore. They have reported they don't feel they need cannabis any longer. Although I miss seeing them, I am thrilled that the reason they came to see us in the first place is resolved! We are here to create wellness not customers. Patients have approached us for a myriad of reasons. To loosen their dependance on opiates, alcohol addiction, cancer care, depression, anxiety, PTSD, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, MS, you name it...Some of these conditions will always require medication however some people have cultivated the tools (diet, exercise, meditation) to step away from daily pharmaceuticals and even cannabis. Cannabis is an off ramp drug, not the gateway. If you're interested in living a better quality of life, ask Nurse Wendy. We have 'no high' options for pain management and anxiety as well as the euphoria inducing strains cannabis is known for. </p>  <p>We love our job and we hope we can pass some of that positive energy on to you!</p> <p></p>

We have instilled Punctuality, Presentation, and Quality as our duty to our community in which we call The Collective Family. The Collective was originated by two young adult agriculturist in the field of Medicinal Cannabis, within their journey holes were found all throughout the medical cannabis field. It was at that moment in time where we as a collective whole thought about actually taking this culture to a whole different level. After the two appalled individuals had encountered multiple experiences with collectives here in the San Diego County. Confused and misconstrued left feeling that facilities/dispensaries didn’t have the right medication which best fit our medical needs, product knowledge about the affects different cannabis also known as indica, sativa, and hybrid. Not only rushed poor customer service but state law knowledge, and most of all agricultural knowledge evolved around discretion to those who love to be apart of a family. The Collective stands and prides itself firmly for our Community with that being said the Community is the number 1 golden priority. The Collective is about informing the community of new innovations in the field of Medical Cannabis in ever field that one would have questions or concerns in regards of under the laws of Prop. 215. We are the first to have a custom tailored medication plan, flexible hours of operation until 4am, business attired delivery drivers, family relationship, weekly blog newsletter all under the oath and loyalty to our community to be happy and discrete about our amazing culture!</p> <p></p>

1391:::Tahoe Herbal Care Delivery:::<p></p> <p> <strong>Tahoe Herbal Care </strong>has been serving the <strong>Truckee/North Lake Tahoe area for over 4 years</strong>! We are a <strong>TRUE COLLECTIVE</strong>, offering top quality medicinal products that are <strong>HOMEGROWN</strong> right here in our little mountain town. Nearly <strong>100% of our medicine, from flowers to concentrates, tinctures &amp; edibles, come from Truckee/Tahoe locals, </strong>the rest within our watershed. So when you support us<strong>, you are also supporting your greater local community. </strong>We pride ourselves in our long-standing vendor relationships and hope you enjoy the <strong>SUPERIOR QUALITY </strong>of our products that come form a<strong> TRUE COLLECTIVE EFFORT.</strong></p> <p></p>
24633:::Tahoe Meds:::<p></p> <p>(530)BUZ-MEDS - Prices INCLUDE taxes. Satisfaction guaranteed. FREE delivery in Truckee w/ 1/8 contribution. Ask about FREE delivery to Kings Beach, Tahoe City, and Squaw Valley. All orders include a FREE Indica or Sativa Cookie. We are bringing North Lake Tahoe top shelf indoor medicines at bottom shelf prices. Try us out and ask about our FREE two day delivery anywhere in the state.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Tahoe Meds guarantees your satisfaction with our product! If you do not feel that you got what you ordered or the quality is less than expected, call us up and we'll fix it or give you a 110% refund. We want all our members to be completely satisfied with our service and product. (We reserve the right to prorate refunds based on quantity returned.)</p>  <p>The organizing members of Tahoe Meds waited patiently for an opportunity to bring North Tahoe patients a storefront with low overhead and sane suggested contributions. Many of our patients come from high cost areas with insanely high overhead for storefronts near their primary residences. Those costs get passed right into the price of the medicines they get there. Truckee has relatively low overhead costs that would result in lower costs for patients when they are visiting here.</p>  <p>Our sincere hope was that the California Supreme court would apply a common sense interpretation to proposition 215 by allowing patients like us to associate collectively and cooperatively at a common physical location forcing our city and others to lift outright bans on physical storefronts. Sadly the recent California Supreme court decision (CITY OF RIVERSIDE V INLAND EMPIRE PATIENTS HEALTH AND WELLNESS CENTER, INC., et al) has put that off until we can successfully lobby or City and/or county officials to make this common sense change. It's going to be a while.</p>  <p>In the interim we are here to make same day deliveries of the medicines you need right to your doorstep in North Lake Tahoe and anywhere in the state (but that takes about 48 hours). </p> <p></p>
27644:::Tahoe Organics:::<p></p> <p>530-563-8097. Free same day delivery. The Best Organic Flower and Full Melt in Tahoe. Organic Indoor/Greenhouse/Outdoor Top Shelf Medicine locally grown for you. A unique collective run by a professional organic grower. All prices include tax and delivery. 100% money back guarantee. </p>  <p>Why Organic? Because synthetic fertilizers are derived from mineral salts that have been mined from the earth and then chemically synthesized using fossil fuels to create inorganic fertilizers. Organic nutrients are derived from worm castings, bat guano, hydrolyzed fish, seaweed, molasses, leonardite and naturally occurring minerals like rock phosphate and then rely on bacteria and microbes to mineralize or &quot;break down&quot; these complex organic substances into plant accessible nutrients. Although synthetically grown medicine may have the same appearance, you can't always judge a book by its cover. It's the organic inputs and soil that produce a flower with flavor unmatched by any other growing technique. </p>  <p>We take pride in the cleanliness and quality of the medicine provided at Tahoe Organics. No harmful pesticides, fungicides, insecticides, as well mold and powdery mildew free. Our medicine is dried for seven days on the plant in a perfectly controlled environment then cured for another week after each flower has been perfectly manicured. This allows for a minimum of two weeks before you as the patient receive the product. Offering the strain and the grower who produced it allows the patient to become familiar with a consistent, quality product without fearing they are medicating with an inferior product that could actually be harmful to their health. </p> <p></p>

The popcorn-sized buds in the sample jar all had a hint of purple under a slathering of sandy-colored crystals. In the shop, I got a strange, fruit-punchy Bubba Kush smell, but at home it had more of a grapey-lavender finish. Smoked, the potent little buds had a sweet, earthy taste and were great for mellowing out and easing anxiety after a stressful day. I also was struck with a mean case of the munchies soon after puffing a bowl, despite the fact that I had just finished a meal. At $25 an eighth, it was a perfect purchase, and one Ive been back for many times.&quot; </p>  <p>When you're the first newspaper pot critic, you end up trying a lot of different bud -- and 2013 was no exception for William Breathes.

25377:::The Healing Gardens Collective:::<p></p> <p>Welcome to The Healing Gardens Collective (A Free Delivery Service)</p>  <p>The Healing Gardens Collective provides safe access to an excellent selection of locally grown medical marijuana, a variety of concentrates, gourmet edibles, lollipops, sodas, seeds, clones, and much more.</p>  <p>The Healing Gardens Collective offers Free Delivery service to its collective members living in Santa Barbara County and Ventura County.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Marijuana Plants</p>  <p>Sativa and Indica are the two main varieties of the cannabis plant used as medicine. The Sativa strains are more of a stimulant, the Indica strains are more of a relaxant. <br />Sativa</p>  <p>Sativa marijuana plants produce a higher proportion of THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol) than CBD (Cannabidiol) compared to Indica plants. This results in more cerebral, soaring, energetic highs. This can stimulate brain activity and may produce hallucinations. Sativas can help with appetite stimulation, relieving depression, migraines, pain and nausea.</p>  <p>Sativa plants grow tall and thin reaching heights of 20ft in one season. Once they begin to flower they reach maturity within 10-16 weeks. They have less chlorophyll than Indica plants and take longer to grow and mature. They also require more light. The yield of a Sativa plant is lower than that of Indicas, but it is very potent. Its flavor ranges from earthy to sweet and fruity. <br />Indica</p>  <p>Indica marijuana plants are essentially the opposite of Sativas. They produce higher levels of CBD than THC resulting in a much heavier, sleepy type of high. The relaxing qualities of Indica strains allow them to be effective for anxiety, pain, nausea, appetite stimulation, sleep, muscle spasms and tremors, among other symptoms.</p>  <p>Indica plants are short and dense with broad leaves. Their higher chlorophyll content results in a shorter growing season with higher yields than Sativas. Once flowering starts they mature in 6 to 8 weeks. The buds are thick and dense, with flavors and aromas ranging from pungent skunk to sweet and fruity. <br />Hybrid</p>  <p>Hybrids are a combination of different Indicas, different Sativas or combinations of the two. How the resulting hybrid strains grow, mature and smoke depends upon the Indica/Sativa percentages they end up containing. </p> <p></p>

No one has ever died from a marijuana overdose, and marijuana has a wide variety of therapeutic applications. Marijuana is frequently beneficial in the treatment of serious medical conditions. Medical marijuana has been deemed legitimate (by at least one court, legislature, and/or government agency in the United States) for treatment of the following medical conditions: AIDS/HIV, Cancer, Glaucoma, Multiple Sclerosis, Scleroderma, Chronic Pain, Nausea, Anxiety, Seizure Disorder Insomnia, Eating Disorders and Crohn's Disease just to name a few. Medical marijuana is the safest and most effective medicine known to mankind. Marijuana is significantly safer than all of the following substances: Aspirin, Advil, Alcohol, Tobacco. Studies have demonstrated that cannabis has analgesic effects in pain conditions secondary to injury (e.g. spinal cord injury) or disease (e.g. HIV disease, HIV drug therapy) of the nervous system. This suggests that cannabis may provide a treatment option for those individuals who do not respond or respond inadequately to currently available therapies. The efficacy of cannabis in treatment-refractory patients also may suggest a novel mechanism of action not fully exploited by current therapies. In addition to nerve pain, CMCR has also supported a study on muscle spasticity in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Such spasticity can be painful and disabling, and some patients do not benefit optimally from existing treatments. The results of the CMCR study suggest that cannabis reduces MS spasticity, at least in the short term, beyond the benefit available from usual medical care.&quot; Source: Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research, &quot;Report to the Legislature and Governor of the State of California presenting findings pursuant to SB847 which created the CMCR and provided state funding,&quot; University of California, (San Diego, CA: February 2010), p. 2. <strong>Indications of Medical Marijuana Therapy: </strong> Chronic pain, Arthritis, Migraine headaches, Glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, Cancer, Post chemo or radiation therapy, Chronic nausea/vomiting, Anorexia (loss of appetite), Depressiony, Anxiety disorder, Multiple sclerosis, Insomnia, Premenstrual syndrome, Seizure disorders, Eating disorders (Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa),Gastric Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Cerebral palsy, Muscle spasm, Asthma, And many more&acirc;€&brvbar;&acirc;€&brvbar; Cannabis growing recommendation is available for indicated patients <strong>Contra-indications: </strong> Schizophrenia, Bipolar disease, Psychotic disease, Severe heart disease. </p> <p></p>

It does not include the mature stalks of the plant, fiber produced from the stalks, oil or cake made from the seeds of the plant, any other compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the mature stalks (except the resin extracted therefrom), fiber, oil, or cake, or the sterilized seed of the plant which is incapable of germination&quot; (H&amp;SC 11018).</p>  <p>2/15/2010 - An excellent review of clinical studies on the medical use of cannabis and cannIbinoids has been published by Arno Hazekamp and Franjo Grotenhermen. The authors summarize 37 different controlled studies in the period July 1, 2005 - August 1, 2009. Eight specifically involved smoked marijuana, all of which indicated medical efficacy. Conditions treated included chronic pain, HIV neuropathy, spinal cord injury, and Hep C. The authors add that at least 110 studies on medical cannabis have been published since 1975. So much for the notion that our drug bureaucrats need more studies on medical marijuana. </p> <p></p>

With decades of experience behind them, the Verde team focuses on each individual harvest, maintaining strict standards of quality and sanitation. Verde focuses on providing their patients with a healthy variety of proven strains, opposed to inundating them with mundane choices of sub-par production or low-potency genetics. The strain selection may seem humble compared to some; this is intentional. Each strain is specifically chosen for it's superior genetic traits, and only select phenotypes are used to produce medicine. Then, the cultivation environment is dialed in for each particular strain, revealing the unique qualities that each has to offer. Quality control is maintained throughout the cultivation, transportation, storage and presentation of the medicine. We ensure no degradation of the product through machine-trimming or compressed storage, quick drying or curing, air or heat damage. Nothing is displayed on the shelves except the highest grades. If we feel any harvest is less-than-the-best, we do not offer it to our patients. This dedication to quality-only product allows new patients to make a safe decision, regardless of their knowledge of art of Cannabis, and provides a &quot;no-bull&quot; selection for more experienced patients. </p> <p></p>
