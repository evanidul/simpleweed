	<h1>Simpleweed Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>
Welcome to Simpleweed.org (the "Site"), provided by SimpleWeed, LLC, and its affiliates, subsidiaries, parent company and other related companies ("Us", "We", or "Simpleweed").  We take protecting your privacy seriously, and we want you to understand exactly how and why we use your information.  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Your use of and/or registration with Simpleweed will constitute your agreement to our policy. If you cannot agree to the terms and conditions set forth below, please do not use the Service (as defined below). Additionally, our Privacy Policy is part of our User Agreement, and by using the Service you agree to both. This Simpleweed.org Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes the information we gather from you when you use the Site, mobile applications, and related services (together, the “Service” or "Services") and how we use, process, and disclose that information. We may add to this Policy with other notices. We may also post additional privacy statements for some portions of the Services. By submitting personal information through our Services, you expressly consent to the transfer of your personal data to our servers in the U.S. for our collection, use, and disclosure in accordance with this Policy.</p>
	<p>
Information We Collect
When you create an account and use our Service, we collect some or all of the following data and types of information from you:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Name</li>
		<li>Contact information such as your email address and phone number</li>
		<li>Demographics information such as your gender and location</li>
		<li>Any other information, such as reviews, ratings, content, and bio, you provide us</li>
		<li>Doctor’s Recommendation</li>
		<li>Driver’s License</li>
		<li>Address</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
If you create an account using, or otherwise connect your account to, a social networking services account (e.g., Twitter or Facebook), we may also collect information provided to us by such social networking service including but not limited to  your: name; email address; birthday; geographic location; interests; profile picture; gender; networks; user ID; list of friends; and any other information you have made public on such social networking account.</p>
	<p>
The posts and comments you make on the Site or Service are not private, even if made to a community not readily accessible to the public. This means that, by default, they are not deleted from our servers – possible forever – and will still be accessible after your account is deleted. However, we only save the most recent version of comments and posts, so your previous edits, once overwritten, will no longer be available.
	</p>
	<p>
We automatically collect information about how you use our services, for example, pages you have viewed and keywords you have searched for. We also collect certain technical information about your device including your Internet protocol address, geo-location information, your browser type, language and identifying information, your operating system and application version, device types, device model and manufacturer, device identifiers, and your device operating system type and version.
	</p>
	<p>
We also use cookies, Web beacons, and URL information to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and which you viewed. Cookies are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which usually stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. Web beacons are digital images that are used to log information on the Services or in our emails. We use Web beacons to manage cookies, count visits, and to learn what marketing works and what does not. We also use Web beacons to tell if you open or act on our emails.</p>
	<p>
Others, including third party analytics service providers and advertising partners may also collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different Web sites when you use our Services, including as described in this Privacy Policy. This Policy does not apply to and we are not responsible for those other parties. Third party analytics services may use cookies and web beacons through our Site (for example Google Analytics, ChartBeat, and Mixpanel) and platform device identifiers and software agents on and through our mobile Services (for example Flurry Analytics, Urban Airship, and Mixpanel) to provide us with information about how you use and interact with our Site. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third parties to learn about your choices about information they collect from you.</p>
	<p>
		<h5>Sharing Of Your Information</h5>

The Services may allow you to connect and share your location, actions, comments, reviews, ratings, content, profile, and information publicly or with other people. You may control some of the categories of personal information shared via your profile from the account settings menu on the Site. Please be mindful of your own privacy needs as you choose whom to connect with and what to share and make public. We cannot control the privacy or security of information you choose to make public or share with others.</p>
	<p>
The Services may also provide you with the option to share certain information from your Simpleweed account with social networking services like Facebook, Google, or Twitter. We are not responsible for the use or re-sharing by others of any of your information once it is made public. If you do not want your information to be made public, you should not use the Simpleweed Services in this manner and/or you should adjust your privacy setting(s) on the applicable social networking service accordingly. We are not responsible for, and we do not control, these social networking services’ privacy practices. Please review the applicable privacy policy for information about how they use your information.</p>

		<h5>Third Party Advertisers</h5>

We permit advertisements to be delivered to you by third party Internet advertising companies (also called ad networks or network advertisers).

We do not have access to or control over cookies, Web beacons, platform device identifiers, software agents, or other technologies that they may use. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third party advertisers. You should check the privacy policy of the third party advertiser to determine how it handles information it separately collects from you.

Simpleweed takes commercially reasonable steps to help protect your Information against loss, misuse and unauthorized access, or disclosure. No company can fully prevent security risks, however.
